\chapter{Access Control and CCTV}

The CCTV has been subjected to a major EI, in order for the
works to comply to new MOI requirements.

The Client has appointed Johnson Controls to carry out these works.
Letter \texttt{HEE 901B/1.3/ZH/jv/16148} dated 22 January 2013 advised the Client about implications on completion and other issues. An extract from the letter, advising the award of containment to the same subcontractor is shown below:

\begin{quotation}
We note that we have over 95\% of the ceilings works completed, inspected and approved. We request that the containment works  be also given to Johnson Controls to avoid unecessary delay claims and excuses by either party.
\end{quotation}

As the works involve the re-opening of ceilings and the installation of over 85,000\si{\meter} of new conduiting and cabling, possibly relocation or major changes to security rooms and given the uncertainty over approvals of the works and the time-frame, no firm commitments can be made as such stage, until such time as we receive a fully resourced programme from Johnson Controls.
