\section{General}
\normalsize
\newthought{By and large, Podia are be completed} by with the exception of areas delayed by the Owner's Finishes Subcontractor. In addition disruption is expected in completed areas in order to implement the latest EI for the Security system. This report analyzes the remaining works based on
ceiling areas and final fix activities for walls.

\section{Current Status}

First and second fix MEP  is approximately 97.4\% complete. In many areas work is almost ready for ceiling closures. The Podia have been delayed with substantial changes by Engineer's Instructions.

\section{Completion Strategy}

We propose that a strategy for completion is implemented by tackling the floors that are \textit{easier} to complete first and then focusing on to the more difficult areas. Adopting such an approach, will enable the workforce to be more easily managed, and imporatntly free large areas for complete de-snagging and commissioning.

\section{Constraints}\index{Podia! constraints}
\label{sec:podium}
Current resources are inadequate to fully re-cover the delays caused by numerous Engineer's Instructions, late material deliveries and the deployment of Specon technicians to the Towers to assist the sub-contractors. However, once the Tower targets are achieved, personnel currently deployed in Towers can be moved to the Podia to boost production. This should include the re-deployment of sub-contractors technicians and is expected to happen shortly after the 15$^{th}$ of September.

\chapter{Merweb Podia}

\newthought{Although} we did manage to reach a good level of completion, numerous Engineer's Instructions have affected the works in the Merweb Podium areas, as well as premature demobilization of QMMC, which has affected the completion of Level 6. We suggest a similar approach to that taken for the other two Towers, by targeting the \textit{easier} floors first.

\section{Current Status}

Basements, Ground Floor, Levels 4,5 and 6 are substantially completed and systems are now being commissioned progressively. 
There are remaining works on Levels 1, 2 and 3. We need to
verify all inspections on completed floors and complete snagging. Any remaining minor third works need to be completed; such minor works include installation of exit lights, access control devices and final fix items for Fire Alarm. Final fixes in staircases need to be completed.


\subsection{Basement 3}

The Plantroom areas are covered under the sections of the report for systems. The Car parking area is covered by the section on Car Park Ventilation systems and works have been completed.


\section{Basement 2}

Area needs a plan to be emptied from materials. Shaft works for ducting are incomplete. Car Park Ventilation (Jet fans have been installed, but not 
electrically connected).

\section{Basement 1}

Substantially completed. 

\section{Ground Floor}

Substantially completed.

\section{Level 1}
Inspection related activities and EIs that follow onto Civil Works.

\section{Level 2}
As for Level 1
\section{Level 3}
As for Level 1

\section{Level 4}

This level houses the Calorifier and Domestic Plant rooms. The Plant room works, which are covered under the relevant systems have been completed and inspected. They and ready for commissioning once gas becomes available. Electrical works have been completed on this floor, inspected, pre-commissioned and activated.

\section{Level 5}

This level houses the ETS Plant rooms, they have been fully completed.

\section{Level 6}

These works have been contracted out to QMMC. A number of EIs have also affected this area. QMMC has demobilized from Site and area is being completed by HLS. Area is substantially completed.

\section{Other Areas}

\subsection{Ramps}

Sprinkler and light fittings have been substantially completed.
