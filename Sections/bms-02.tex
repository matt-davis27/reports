\newthought{Physical installation is substantially completed} and approximately 75\% of the T\&C has been carried out, so far without any major issues. remaining physical activities relate
to completion of the Kitchen equipment subcontractor's works (condenser systems), setting up of the central system and activation of software and
graphics.

\section{Current Status}
The current status of commissioning activities is shown in
Table~\ref{tbl:bmsstatus}. The nature of the works is such
that it is ahrd to make prediction as to an exact date
for completion. However, current estimates point to 
end April 2013.

\section{Current Constraints} 

Current constraints are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gas related points (Gasco not fully ready yet).
\item Askar related points (equipment not on site).
\item Missing materials fcu cards.
\item Boiler commissioning. Can only be done once gas is available on
      site.
\end{enumerate}
