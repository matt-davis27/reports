\chapter{Car Park Ventilation}

\newthought{The Car Park ventilation system} has been completed and the Manufacturer has brought specialist technicians from Spain to test the system. However, an issue arose during commissioning and following the Supplier's recommendation an additional repeater panel has to be installed. Currently we are awaiting for confirmation of delivery dates. The system will need to be re-tested. We expect that these works will be completed between 1 Feb - 15 February.
