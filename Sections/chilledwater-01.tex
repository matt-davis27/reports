\newthought{Chilled Water Plantrooms}  have been physically completed, pre-commissioned, part-commissioned and put into operation, in order to remove the temporary wild air installations, which were removed in October 2011.

\section{Basement Qatar Cool Plantrooms}
\index{Qatar Cool Plantrooms}
The works have been completed, pending minor snags. Aluminium cladding is currently being installed with the following target dates. Civil finishes remain incomplete.
 
 

\section{Interconnection Piping to Level 5}

Works have been completed and tested. Commissioning has partially started, where possible.

\section{Level 5 ETS Plantrooms}
These plant rooms have been physically completed in order to provide \emph{wild air}, however, they still require the completion of the balance of pumps and electrical works, as well as snagging etc.

      Plantroom   &  Details & Milestone Date  \\

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Builder's Works}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Louvres for AHU rooms. Mostly incomplete. This precludes commissioning of the majority of AHUs. 
\item Ceiling Closures (see individual areas for constraints). 
\item Materials Issues
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Human resources}
\begin{enumerate}[a.)]
\item       Currently CML carries inadequate resources to complete the balancing works on time. This is an item of the the highest priority. \TODO{YL to send weekly letters}. These are detailed further under the section for Commissioning.
\item BMS Commissioning for AHUs is not progressing due to Shajan not having adequate resources.\TODO{Warren to issue weekly delay letters}. These are covered in more detail, under the section for BMS works.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Record of Delays}
Delays for individual issues have been handled in the Main claims document. Serious delays have been encountered all over due to ceiling void constraints reducing productivity.

\section{Commissioning}

Commissioning of the Chilled water system has started. However, the balancing of the Chilled Water system is not progressing, due to resource issues with CML.
