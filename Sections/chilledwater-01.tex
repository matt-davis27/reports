\newthought{Chilled Water Plantrooms}  have been physically completed, pre-commissioned, commissioned substantially and put into operation.

All Plantrooms have been completed and are operational. The major chilled water plant rooms at Level 5 and B3 (Qatar Cool) are completed and operational. Cladding works have been completed. All AHU rooms have been completed.

\section{Constraints}

The majority of the works remaining are the connections to the Walk-in freezer condensers. These works have been delayed due to the Owner Direct Contractor (Askar) having failed to deliver and install the equipment last November. We are still uncertain as to when Askar will install these units. There is considerable work from our part after their installation.

\section{Commissioning}

Commissioning of the Chilled water system has started. However, the balancing of the Chilled Water system is not progressing, due to resource issues with CML.
