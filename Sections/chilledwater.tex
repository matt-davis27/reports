\newthought{The Chilled Water Plantrooms are expected}  to be completed by late September. The Level 5 Plantrooms have been substantially completed during June,  in order to provide wild air to the Towers. The Qatar Cool Plantrooms in basements  are at an advanced stage (currently hydro-testing).  We expect these systems to be fully running and the Chilled Water System balanced in the Towers by the end of October. \sidenote{Subject to BMS and other materials being available. Control valve deliveries for Qatar Cool Plantrooms may extend these dates, seriously.}

\section{Basement Qatar Cool Plantrooms}
\index{Qatar Cool Plantrooms}
The following are plantroom milestone dates \sidenote{Milestones are for Mechanical works, electrical works and BMS works are depended on deliveries.}:

Outstanding works include the installation of balance pumps and seals. \sidenote{These were expected late July, early August, but have been delayed due to Commercial issues. These are now expected next week.}, electrical works, installation of controls, testing and inspections. The most time consuming part are the inspections, testing and insulation that are all consequential.\sidenote{During the Wild Air operation some inspections were omitted, these need to be closed. A detailed Method Statement has been submitted and we are expecting to close the issues soon.}

For electrical works, we are constrained by deliveries of equipment by the Verger. Mostly due to changes in equipment instructed by EIs, although situation is improving.
Another item that is delaying completion is the control valves which have not as yet been finalized. \sidenote{They have now been approved, but quoted deliveries are too long. Procurement is trying to better these.}


\section{Interconnection Piping to Level 4}

This interconnection risers from Basements to Level 5 need to be  completed in order to switch-over the temporary wild air installations to Qatar Cool chilled water.\sidenote{For Qatar Cool Connection targets, see Appendix B}. Large sections of these works have been completed, but finalization is pending the delivery of branch valves. In many instances branch valves have not been indicated on schematics, but these have to be installed to enable progressive testing and commissioning.

      \toprule
      Plantroom   &  Details & Milestone Date  \\
      \midrule
      Rotana       &  8   &  $26^{th}$ August 2010  \\
      Merweb      &  12 &  30th August 2010  \\
      Shangrila    &  12 &  30th August 2010  \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
 
  \end{center}
  

These are works handled directly by Specon, but in order to speed-up the works portions of this piping will be sub-contracted to Nidhi and possibly MEPE. Dates are subject to commercial issues being expedited for extending Nidhi's work.


\section{Level 5 ETS Plantrooms}
These plant rooms have been substantially completed in order to provide \emph{wild air}, however, they still require the completion of the balance of pumps and electrical works, as well as snagging etc.

\begin{center} 
    \begin{tabular}{lccl}
      \toprule
      Plantroom   &  Details & Milestone Date  \\
      \midrule
      Rotana       &  8   &  $26^{th}$ August 2010  \\
      Merweb      &  12 &  20th August 2010  \\
      Shangrila    &  12 &  30th August 2010  \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
 
  \end{center}

Once again we envisage problems with the delivery of Control Valves. Numerous other issues remain to fully close issues with the Consultants.

\section{Qatar Cool Connection}

The major constraints in obtaining Qatar Cool Connections are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Kahraama Power\index{Kahraama Power On}  on
\item Completion of all Chilled Water piping in Podia
\item Flushing in Podia
\item Balancing of Tower Chilled Water Systems
\item Delivery of Control Valves
\item Commissioning of Tower Chilled Water, VFDs etc
\end{enumerate}

It is estimated that flushing - will take between 15-30 days - as piping is mostly horizontal and more difficult to clean debri. However, based with discussions with Qatar Cool, we might be able to get a connection earlier, subject to identifying circuits that can be isolated and flushed individually. However, it is unlikely to do so without all controls working and Kahraama permanent power being available. Dates for the most optimistic scenario are shown below.
