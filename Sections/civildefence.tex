\chapter{Civil Defence Approval}

Civil Defence Inspections can only take place when the Building Operations have been completed, when the full Fire Fighting,  Fire Alarm, Staircase Pressurization and Smoke Exhaust systems have been completed tested and commissioned. We expect that this will only be possible at the earliest by February or March  2011. However, we will re-evaluate these dates once the works progress a bit further. \out{Civil Defence approval}{30 Apr 2013}

Recent experience from the Phase II inspections, point to a number of issues that are expected to be raised as EIs. We should pressurize HOK to issue these EIs at the earliest in order to minimize their impact on costs and time.

A substantial amount of paper work would also need to be packaged for these inspections, including updating of all current Shop drawings. This should start at the earliest. 

The Qatar Civil Defence Department if approached can unofficially inspect the works earlier in order to identify problem areas earlier.

The Civil Deefence related sections have been discussed uner separate headings and will not be repeated here. We may also be able to negotiate with the Civil Defence Department to have  piecemeal inspections (per Building).
