\chapter{Civil Defence Approval}
\label{civildefence}
Civil Defence Inspections can only take place when the Building Operations have been completed, when the full Fire Fighting,  Fire Alarm, Staircase Pressurization and Smoke Exhaust systems have been completed tested and commissioned. We expect that this will only be possible at the earliest by end April  2013. However, we will re-evaluate these dates once the works progress a bit further. \out{Civil Defence approval}{30 Apr 2013}


The Qatar Civil Defence Department if approached can unofficially inspect the works earlier in order to identify problem areas earlier. However, at this stage it is bound to catch rather known problems than unknown problems.

The Civil Defence related sections have been discussed under separate headings and will not be repeated here. See \tref{cdd} for status and details
