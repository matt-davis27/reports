\chapter{Domestic Water System - Cold Side}

The Domestic Water System can be divided for convenience in the following sections.

\section{Constraints}
Current constraints revolve around Main Contractor's and fit-out Contractors final fix activities. There are still information issues constraining the Rotana Domestic Water system. 

A number of pumps have been changed via an Engineer's instruction. Pump deliveries have been delayed due to this. Although pumps were expected to arrive at end of June, they still have not arrived. \index{Material Delays!Domestic Pumps}

\section{Current Status}

All water tanks have been installed at Level 4. These remain to be fully tested and inspected. All interconnecting piping has been placed on hold pending finalization of pumps. Most of this piping is made of copper. We do not have at this stage an adequate number of copper brazers, but expect assistance from Nidhi and MEPE.
