\newthought{The Hot Water System} has been physically completed.

The HWS provides hot water for domestic use, as well for re-heat to all Air Handling Units. For the system to be fully operational and commissioned it requires that the gas system  be in operation and gas available to the building. It also requires that final fix items for bathrooms are completed. None of these can be accomplished by end of October. By end of October physical completion of all works is possible. It is also possible that all pumping circuits can be placed in operation, thus rendering the system in a position to be commissioned once the balance of the pre-requisites are completed. (See table \ref{tbl:HWSKeydates} in the side margin for major key dates).

\section{Current Status}

The boilers, calorifiers and pumps are in place for all Towers and the major pipelines completed. 

\section{Constraints}

Current constraints involve upstream activities for procurement and design. The boiler flue systems are still to be sub-contracted. The Table below, summarizes briefly the major constraints, the expected due date in order to achieve October completion and the action required to close the issue. Balance of all equipment need to be air-freighted and ordered within the next five dates, in order to meet deadlines. We also expect a deign freeze by 5th August 2010.

Since all six Plantrooms are targetted simultaneously, once design and materials are completed, it will be necessary to add technicians in order to complete the Plantrooms timeously.

Another issue that has to be resolved is the Commissioning of the Plant. Commercial issues with the local agents might force us to use a different Company from the original Supplier. This is currently being investigated and is expected to be resolved soon.

\section{Work Organization}
The work is organized (currently) in sections. An overall responsible person from a systems point of view is to be appointed to streamline activities. The Boiler rooms in the basement have been sub-contracted to MEPE, whereas the Level 4 Plantrooms have been sub-contracted to Nidhi and with Specon completing all interconnecting pipework in Podia. Tower piping is the responsibility of the Tower sub-contractors.


\section{Sequence for Switch-on}

In order to enable progressive commissioning (can remove one to two months from final handover date), switch-on and testing of ciruits must follow the  sequence shown in table \ref{tbl:switchon}.
