\chapter{Drainage System}

\newthought{The Drainage System is already at an advanced stage}. Work that could be completed has been completed. Areas that are currently incomplete are third fix activities that follow finishes. There
are also works constrained by activities of Finishing Contractors works in Towers.


\newthought{Drainage Plantrooms} such as the Grey Water Treatment Plant have been completed in terms of Mechanical Works and Electrical works.
Commissioning (other than switch-on) is not possibe until such time as the EI for concrete tanks is completed (Merweb and Rotana). We expect commissioning for Shangrila to start by 30 Mar 2013.


The installation can be divided into the following broad sections
