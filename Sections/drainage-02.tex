\chapter{Drainage System}

\newthought{The Drainage System is already at an advanced stage}. Work that could be completed has been completed. Areas that are currently incomplete are third fix activities that follow finishes.


\newthought{Drainage Plantrooms} such as the Grey Water Treatment Plant have been completed in terms of Mechanical Works and the balance works.

From a systems point of view our aim is to be able to pour water at the highest point
in the Tower and see it flowing into the Municipal Drain or the Grey Water Treatment Plant etc.
as soon as possible. 

The installation can be divided into the following broad sections
