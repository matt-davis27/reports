\newthought{It is extremely difficult} to complete the Fire Fighting installation by October. Current issues, are lack of quick response by Nafco in the main plantroom, the delivery and approval of remaining materials and in many areas the lack of RCP drawings. Commercial issues with FM-200 works are still to be cleared. This has taken the best part of two months, but has now been resolved.

\newthought{Civil Defence issues} are likely to surface, as the Design does not meet the latest Civil Defence requirements. \sidenote{Some of the issues that arose in Phase II, are the type of hose-reels that are installed, the Method of smoke extraction and pressurization of Lift Lobbies. The Civil Defence Department has also requested that all ceiling voids that are greater than one meter depth have sprinkler void protection. This issue can seriously impact the completion of Podia, public areas. These issues were raised with HOK and CANSULT earlier in the year, but so far Specon has not received any instructions}

\newthought{Materials have not as yet been finalized} for the whole Project. Currently Site personnel are expected to work from two sets of drawings the MEP Shop drawings as well as the ID drawings\sidenote{Brought on by EHAF and HOK and the delays in ID Shop Drawings, which were issued - after MEP drawings were completed.}, whereas at the same time expecting the installation to conform to NFPA standards. Naturally this has propagated errors and confusion on Site. \sidenote[][50pt]{For example in Rotana upper floors, sprinklers have been installed 500 mm from the soffit of the slab, whereas NFPPA 13 only permits these to be 300 mm from soffit.} 

\section{Current Status and Targets}

The current status is shown in Tables \ref{tbl:fire1}, \ref{tbl:fire2} and \ref{tbl:fire3} which indicate what is necessary to activate the systems up to 
the zone control valves. Once this is achieved it will be easier to progressively switch-on areas as they are completed.

\section{Recommended Action}
In order to reverse the situation, the following should be adopted at the earliest \sidenote{Sprinkler heads can only be fitted once ceilings are completed and painted. In public areas the Fit-out Contractor is currently delaying these works.}

	\begin{center} 
	    \begin{tabular}{lp{3cm}l}
	      \toprule
	      Action   &  Details& Due Date  \\
	      \midrule
	      Design Issues       & Co-ordinated MEP drawings should be issued, not just ID drawings. ID drawings should be expedited. 
  &  $26^{th}$ August 2010  \\
	      Material Issues &&\\
	      Resourcing && \\
	      FM-200 & Design/commercial&\\ 
	      \bottomrule
	    \end{tabular}
          \end{center}

Resourcing of further sub-contractors is essential. These can be employed both in the Podia, as well as Towers, where in our opinion the current sub-contractors will be unable to cope. One possibility is to utilize Crompton and QMMC who are expected to complete the Fire Fighting works in the Towers by the $15^{th}$ of Septemeber\sidenote{Sprinkler heads can only be fitted once ceilings are completed and painted. In public areas the Fit-out Contractor is currently delaying these works}.


\section{Constraints}

A number of sprinklers are still to be delivered, due to issues with Naffco. HS took action to procure from Tyco (Viking), which HOK duly failed. HS resubmitted and are awaiting the reply. Similar material issues exist for electrical items to be supplied by Naffco to finish pump switch-on.
