\newthought{The Standby Generators} physical works within the Generator Plantrooms have been completed. The cooling tower cooling systems serving the Generators have also been completed and tested.

\section{Current Status}

The generators are in place, as well as all the electrical support installations, such as cable trays and cable ladders. Mechanical piping works for the Cooling Tower circuits have been completed. We still
battling to get the day-tank close all inspections.

\section{Sequence for Switch-on}
\normalsize
In order to enable progressive commissioning early switch-on will be targetted. Although it may not be possible to achieve overall switch-on within the time frame envsisaged, sub-systems can be tested earlier on for example, the Cooling Tower circuit, the Chemical Treatment for same and the Fuel system. On the Electrical side, it will only be possible to carry full tests, once a substantial electrical load can be ready for switch-on. However, we expect all cable testing and inspections to be completed by the 30th October.

\section{Constraints}
\subsection{Fuel system}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Woquod tanks are not in place.\TODO{Sripathy action list}
\item Day tanks have not been delivered.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Commercial Issues}

The appointment of a subcontractor for commissioning has been issued to HLG on the . We have not had a response as yet. This is expected to delay commissioning with a knock-on effect on the Civil Defence Inspections.
