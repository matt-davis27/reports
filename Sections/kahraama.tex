\chapter{Kahraama Power On}
 \label{ch:kahraama}

Kahraama power on is expected to be in September for Rotana and early October for Shangri-la and Merweb. The work involved is the testing and commissioning of 22 panels and 12  transformers.

We expect small deviations form the above dates due to the Ramadan holidays and the difficulty to arrange inspections by Kahraama during this period.

Power-on was expected earlier but has been affected by:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Completion of cable termination both ends and cable pulling. \sidenote{Affected by commercial issues with MBK}
\item  Installation of tripping batteries\sidenote{These have been purchased and a submission made to HOK to incorporate these permanently into the works}.
\item  Completion of FM 200\sidenote{Commercial issues with Nafco have now been resolved}.
\item  Complete repairs to Schneider Panels\sidenote{Original supplier not responding. Action has been taken to appoint a different Supplier}.
\item  An attempt to reach agreement  reach with Schneider Doha for the testing and commissioning of the MV panels and Transformers failed due to excessive costs. Agrrement with ATS.
\end{enumerate}

Target days are as shown below:
