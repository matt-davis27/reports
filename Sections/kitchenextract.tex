\newthought{The Kitchen Extract System} can be physically completed before the end of October 2010, provided Askar installs all kitchen extract hoods and all co-ordination issues and EIs are resolved early. (See Table \ref{tbl:KEkeydates} for key dates, the dates are based on the assumption that Key Constraints will be removed before they affect construction).

\section{Current Status}

The kitchen extract system is made up of a series of black steel ductwork, extract fans and Ecological Units. The latter treat the air to  remove odours and contaminants, so as to enable the discharge of air at lower levels than the roof of the Towers. Most of the units are at Level~6, whereas the main kitchens are at Basement~1. Since this duct work is generally of substantial depth, large co-ordination issues remain to close the design. However, installation has started and orders have been substantially completed.

The Ecological Units have been installed, but they have not been connected as yet electrically and the ductwork is still pending. Final discharge louvers still need to be detailed. 

\section{Constraints}

Current constraints are human resources for ductwork installation and certain design issues involving co-ordination. Delivery of MCC panels for electrical hook-up is expected by end of August. Delivery of black steel ducting has started, mock-ups approved by the Engineer. This ductwork was originally to be manufactured with flanged joints (as per Phase II). However, the Engineer insisted that this ductwork is now of an \emph{all welded} type construction.  This is expected to slow down construction works. 

None of these constraints are impossible to resolve within a reasonable time. However, unless a full audit of these systems takes place  and we ensure that no redundant re-works are carried out due to co-ordination issues, completion dates can be met. We also expect MEPE to increase the number of personnel working on these systems, once all design, co-ordination and approval issues are resolved.

\section{Work Organization}
The work is organized (currently) in sections. An overall responsible person from a systems point of view is Ritzie. For the section under subcontracts (Ecological Units) is George Georgiou.


\section{Sequence for Switch-on}

In order to enable progressive commissioning an early switch on of Ecological Units is to be targetted. Key switch-on dates will  follow the  sequence shown in table \ref{tbl:switchon}. This Table also indicates the key personnel involved.
