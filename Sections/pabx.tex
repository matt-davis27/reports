\newthought{The Telephone and Data Systems} are nearing completion with the PABX rooms in a state where telephones
can be connected in the near future. The system for practical
purposes is divided into the PABX rooms and the network. The network 
installation is still work in progress, mainly for terminations, testing 
labeling and replacement of cabinets to acommodate Engineer's Instuctions on convergent networks.\sidenote{This refers to EI-266 \& EI-815-E, scheme approved by Owner via letter dated 18 Nov 2012. Currently the Owner is disputing time implications.}
