\newthought{The Staircase Pressurization} systems are expected to be completed by the 25 February 2012. Physical works have been completed and commissioning has been completed for Rotana and Shangrila. The Merweb has been delayed due to the installation of sensor wire.

No further constraints exist in regards to the commissioning of this service, however temporary doors and closures need to be changed to permanent by HLG before the final inspection by Civil Defence. An issue with the Engineer regarding performance tests is expected to be resolved once full integration tests are completed or earlier.
