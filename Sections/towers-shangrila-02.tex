\chapter{Shangrila Tower}

\newthought{The physical installation} of the Shangrila Tower works are currently estimated at 97\% completion. Remaining items are described in the sections below.  Most of the remaining items  are constrained on non-personnel related issues. Commissioning has commenced for some of the mechanical systems (water, fan-coil units). Issues that affect Testing and Commissioning are described in Table~\ref{SLsystems}. Currently QMMC averages 16 personnel on site. 

\section{Issues with HOK}

\begin{enumerate}
\item EI No. 358 additional funnel drain for Ice Maker, affecting floors L41-L22 HK and Chute area.
\item EI No. 228 additional funnel drain for Ice Maker, near shaft 2. Instead of funnel drain normal drain was installed. Floor 9-21.
\end{enumerate}
