\chapter*{Update}

Given the current constraints of the Project, we are satisfied that the general direction of the Project is doing well. Physical Installations in Towers and Podia have been completed in their majority and third fix activities are following the pace of both the Main Contractor as well as Fit-out activities. 

Concerns remain as to the high level of changes necessary to keep up with the latest EIs and RFIs that are slowing down the works and preclude a reasonable implementation of our Commissioning Plan.



Commercial constraints have imposed a reduction of personnel and still create bottlenecks with remaining materials.

The Commissioning Management Contract with CML has expired and this is not going to be renewed. This will further stress our Engineering resources. The required commissioning period for the Project needs to be extended, as currently there is inadequate resource to achieve the targets.

\section*{Current Constraints affecting completion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Disruption due to Commercial issues.
\item Continued disruption with EIs and other changes.
\item Premature demobiliziation.
\item Demobilization of Crompton due to Commercial issues.
\item Slow down by all sub-contractors due to commercial issues.
\item BMS Supplier
\item Fire Protection
\item Balance materials for Qatar Cool Plantrooms
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Demobilization}

Since October the staff and technicians has been reduced substantially. 

\section*{Recommendations}
Our recommendation is to focus our attention and resources as per the original Plan, Tower by Tower.

Although we are trying our best to continue the works despite the disruptions experienced with the above issues. Decisive steps need to be taken to remedy the situation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item All orders ready to be delivered and pending due to commercial constraints need to be cleared. It will be easier to negotiate terms with Creditors, rather than keep the orders back.

\item Subcontractor payments and VO approvals need to be processed.


\item A decision to stop all works on EIs received after August needs to be taken.

\item Last minute additional resources will be necessary.

\item A larger cash account must be allocated to the Project to eneable procurement of urgent materials that have either been missed or are subject to commercial issues.

\end{enumerate}
