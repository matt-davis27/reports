\chapter*{Update}

\newthought{Given the current constraints} of the Project, we are satisfied that the general direction of the Project is doing well and we will be in a position to offer the works for Civil Defence Inspection at end of April and shortly thereafter to  handover the buildings to the Operators.

Physical installations in Towers and Podia have been completed in their majority and final fix activities are following the pace of the Fit-out activities carried out by the Owner's Direct Contractor. 

EIs, RFIs and other constraints have slowed down the works and obstructed a reasonable implementation of our original Closure and Commissioning Plan. Commissioning is carried out on works completed

The aim of this report is to summarize the status of the works
and propose a reasonable plan for Closure of the Works and the implementation of a Commissioning Plan.


\section*{Objectives}

I general we are proposing a focus where areas can be fully completed, as well as the enabling of commissioning of all systems to take place.  We list milestone dates for substantial completion. \sidenote{Substantial defined as completion of all physical works, excluding certain EIs and works affected by delays due to Owner's Direct Contractors. As for commissioning, our definition of substantial is to complete all activities relating to Civil Defence Inspection. }

\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Item  &Area   & Milestone \\
\midrule
\inc     & Podium Rotana      & 16 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Rotana       & 16 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Podium Shangrila  & 16 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Shangrila    & 28 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Merweb Podium    & 30 Apr 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Merweb      & 30 Apr 2013\\

\end{longtable}

This is a very tight schedule and the following steps are being implemented to secure its success and minimize the risk of overuns.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Instituted over-time works for all tradesmen.
\item  Deployment of Electrical Commissioning Manager from HLS UAE to Site. (Already mobilized to Site).
\item  Financial incentive to all subcontractor's to allow for submission of claims every two weeks.
\item Hiring of additional 20 electricians from ERE.
\item Plan deployment of further technicians to be hired from Manpower Supply companies.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Personnel}


 Table~\ref{personnel} summarizes the manpower currently on the Project. This is inadequate at the moment to complete the works as planned. We require at least another 30 electricians, 20 duct erectors and 15 plumbers.

\section*{Current Constraints affecting completion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Continued disruption with EIs and other changes. These EIs will be scheduled for completion after the Civil Defence Inspection (see Tables~\ref{EIsphase3a}\&\ref{EIsphase3b}.
\item Fire Protection (issues with Naffco). Currently we meeting Naffco regularly and their new management is genuinely trying to solve the issues, however still they are unable to keep to any concrete program.
\item Imbalances in resources between the Main Contractor, MEP Subcontractors and Finishing Contractor. This needs to be addressed in order to achieve our completion projections.
\end{enumerate}
