\chapter*{Update}

Given the current constraints of the Project, we are satisfied that the general direction of the Project is doing well and we will be in a position to offer the works for Civil Defence Inspection at end of March and shortly thereafter to enable the Operators to take possession of the Hotels.

Physical installations in Towers and Podia have been completed in their majority and final fix activities are following the pace of both the Main Contractor as well as Fit-out activities. 

EIs, RFIs and other constraints have slowed down the works and obstructed a reasonable implementation of our original Closure and Commissioning Plan.

\section*{Objectives}

The aim of this report is to summarize the status of the works
and propose a reasonable plan for Closure of the Works and the implementation of a Commissioning Plan.

I general we are proposing a focus where areas can be fully completed, as well as the enabling of commissioning of all systems to take place. We suggest to start focusing on the
Shangri-la Hotel first, as this presents more difficulties.

\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Item  &Area   & Milestone \\
\midrule
\inc     & Podium Rotana    & 16 Feb 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Rotana     & 16 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Podium Shangrila & 30 Jan 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Shangrila  & 15 Feb 2013\\
\inc     & Merweb Podium    & 17 Mar 2013\\
\inc     & Tower Merweb     & 30 Apr 2013\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We suggest a 4-7 week cycle for each Hotel at which point we expect that all physical works will close (including comments, FORs and NCRs) and the enabling of all systems to be commissioned. A small Team can remain to continue closing any issues that arise out of these activities and to follow-up on activities delayed by the Fit-out subcontractor.

Within Podia the following sequence is preferred, whereas in the Towers a top to bottom sequence will be followed.

\midrule
1     & B1 & 20 Jan\\

10    & L5 & 10 Feb\\
11    & GF & 20 Feb\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Floor sequence of works.}
\end{table}

Sequence as shown is not that important and the logic behind it, is to enable other trades, such as Dragoni to complete the
works before concentrating in the area. Also we expect the CCTV
changes to affect these areas and we prefer to work in them
once all the other areas are completed.

More details can be found in the relevant area and system sections of the report.

\section*{Current Constraints affecting completion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Disruption due to Commercial issues.
\item Continued disruption with EIs and other changes.
\item Premature demobiliziation and large number of personnel resigning.
\item Demobilization of Al-Jaber due to Commercial issues.
\item Slow down by all sub-contractors due to commercial issues.
\item Fire Protection
\item Imbalances in resources between the Main Contractor, MEP Subcontractors and Finishing Contractor. This needs to be addressed in order to be able to improve on our completion projections.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Demobilization}

We have experienced higher than normal attrition of staff and technicians. 

\section*{Recommendations}
Our recommendation is to focus our attention and resources on a Tower by Tower rather than spreading technicians over the full extend of the works.
