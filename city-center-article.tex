\chapter{Introduction}


This prestigious Hospitality Industry Project for the Al Rayyan Tourism Investment Company, is located in the heart of Doha and it consists of five hotels and large Podia, housing hotel common areas, restaurants, shops and ancillary areas. 

HLS was appointed to complete the works after the previous sub-contractor failed to deliver and its contract terminated. Under normal circumstances Hotel projects present challenges due to the large number of services, their concentration and the involvement of diverse stakeholders. HLS faced the additional challenge of having to complete the design, to mobilize adequate resources to produce over 2000 drawings, over 800 submittals and to remove and re-work substandard works and to complete approximately 400 million QR of MEP works.

The management of changes presented a special challenge for this Project. So far we have received Engineer's Instructions and we have issued over 3000 RFIs. Each and every change moves the completion date a little further away.

The Project developed in three phases consists of five high-rise luxurious hotels, large podia,
retail and restaurant areas and spreads over 330,000 square metres. 

The two 50-storey Towers on the west of the Mall house the Renaissance Doha City Center Hotel and The Courtyard and Marriot Executive apartments; they provide a total of 462 rooms and 124 executive apartments. This phase was completed in May 2011 and is now operating.

Three more 50-storey towers rise on the east of the Mall and house the Shangri-La, Rotana and Merweb Hotels. The Hotels are currently in their finishing stage and are being commissioned.

Shangri-la consists of  269 luxury guest rooms and 54 apartments, while Rotana  has 304 guest rooms and 92 apartments. A further 256 guest rooms and 97 apartments are provided by the Merweb hotel.

The \textsc{mep} services consist of over 40 different systems that include in summary air-conditioning and ventilation, electrical systems including stand-by generators, domestic hot and cold services,  life safety systems including sprinklers and smoke ventilation; security and access control; data and telecommunications and a plethora of other ancillary systems that satisfies the needs of smart buildings. All \textsc{mep} services were constructed to the high standards of the Operators and the Designers under strict quality control and safety standards

The provision of wild air and power were two important milestones that had to be provided on time. Wild Air was provided via temporary chillers of 3000 tons of refrigeration.
 All Kahraama inspections and Qatar Cool inspections were passed the first time either with minor comments or without comments.


Sadly, although the purpose of the provision of wild air was to allow the Owner's subcontractors to move in and complete their part of the works, this was only done about a year later.

\end{marginfigure}

The challenges facing this development were the co-ordination of a large number of services in constrained ceiling spaces and vertical path ways, logistical problems in moving over kilometers of piping and equipment on time to the work areas and the imposition of a strict quality assurance plan.
