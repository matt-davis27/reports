The output routine is one of the more mysterious pieces
of \tex.
and as  David Salomon noted\footnote{TUGboat/tb-11-1/tb27salomon.pdf}, advanced users hardly need to be convinced that an unerstanding of OTRs is important, since they must be used whenever, special output is desired.
 The chapter of the \texbook discussing output
routines claims that designing output routines makes one
achieve the level of a `\tex Grandmaster'.
As is so often the case, mastery of the concept of an
output routine in plain TEX will only barely prepare you
for the complexities awaiting you with LATEX’s variant of
an output routine.

The subject is considered complex for the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item OTRS are asynchronous with the
rest of TEX (this is explained later) and involve difficult concepts such as splitting boxes and insertions.
\item Certain features, which could be useful in OTRs are not supported by \tex. Specifically there are no commands to identify marks, rules and whatsits in a box and to break up a line of text into individual characters.
\end{enumerate}

\tex\ 's page breaking algorithm is simpler than the line breaking one. The reason for this is that global optimization
of page breakpoints, the way is done in the paragraph algorithm is prohibitively in terms of memory (especially in the 1980s).

Theoretically, page breaking is a more complicated \footnote{\href{test}{http://www.cs.utk.edu/~eijkhout/594-LaTeX/handouts/breaking/page-tutorial.pdf}}than line breaking. First we will briefly discuss the algoithms that \tex\ actually
uses.


\section{Page breaking algorithm}

The problem of page breaking has two components. One is that of stretching or shrinking
available glue (mostly around display math or section headings) to find typographically
desirable breakpoints. The other is that of placing ‘floating’ material, such as tables and
figures. These are typically placed at the top or the bottom of a page, on or after the first
page where they are referenced. These ‘inserts’, as they are called in TEX, considerably
complicate the page breaking algorithms, as well as the theory.

\subsection{Typographical constraints}

There are various typographical guidelines for what a page should look like, and TEX has
mechanisms that can encourage, if not always enforce, this behaviour.

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item The first line of every page should be at the same distance from the top. This changes
if the page starts with a section heading which is a larger type size.

\item The last line should also be at the same distance, this time from the bottom. This
is easy to satisfy if all pages only contain text, but it becomes harder if there are
figures, headings, and display math on the page. In that case, a ‘ragged bottom’ can
be specified.

\item  A page may absolutely not be broken between a section heading and the subsequent
paragraph or subsection heading.

\item It is desirable that

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item the top of the page does not have the last line of a paragraph started on the
preceding page

\item the bottom of the page does not have the first line of a paragraph that continues
on the next page.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}



For ordinary purposes you will probably fnd that \tex's automatic
method of page breaking is satisfactory. And when it occasionally gives unpleasant
results, you can force the machine to break at your favorite place by
typing |\eject|. But be careful: |eject| will cause \tex to stretch the page
out, if necessary, so that the top and bottom baselines agree with those on other
pages.  If you want to eject a short page, filling it with blank space at the bottom,
type | \vfill\eject|  instead.

\section{The current page and the recent contributions list}

The main vertical list of TEX is divided in two parts: the \emph{current page} and the list of \emph{recent
contributions}. Any material that is added to the main vertical list is appended to the recent
contributions; the act of moving the recent contributions to the current page is known as
\emph{exercising the page builder}.

Every time something is moved to the current page, TEX computes the cost of breaking the
page at that point. If it decides that it is past the optimal point, the current page up to the
best break so far is put in |box255| and the remainder of the current page is moved back
on top of the recent contributions. If the page is broken at a penalty, that value is recorded
in |outputpenalty|, and a penalty of size 10 000 is placed on top of the recent contributions;
otherwise, |outputpenalty| is set to 10 000.

If the current page is empty, discardable items that are moved from the recent contributions
are discarded. This is the mechanism that lets glue disappear after a page break and at the
top of the first page. When the first non-discardable item is moved to the current page, the
|topskip| glue is inserted; 



\section{When is the page builder activated?}


The page builder comes into play in the following circumstances.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Around paragraphs: after the \cmd{everypar} tokens have been inserted, and after the
paragraph has been added to the vertical list. See the end of this chapter for an
example.

\item  Around display formulas: after the \cmd{everydisplay} tokens have been inserted, and after
the display has been added to the list.

\item  After \cmd{par} commands, boxes, insertions, and explicit penalties in vertical mode.

\item  After an output routine has ended.
\end{enumerate}



In these places the page builder moves the recent contributions to the current page. Note that
\tex\  need not be in vertical mode when the page builder is exercised. In horizontal mode,
activating the page builder serves to move preceding vertical glue (for example, \cmd{parskip},
\cmd{abovedisplayskip}) to the page.

The \cmd{end} command – which is only allowed in external vertical mode – terminates a TEX job,
but only if the main vertical list is empty and \cmd{deadcycles} = 0. If this is not the case the
combination


|\hbox{}\vfill\penalty+ $-2^{30}$|

is appended, which forces the output routine to act.

\section{The depth of the current page}
The depth of the page is important since normally in good typesetting successive pages should have the same (or almost the same vertical size. (flushbottom). The height of a page is controlled and set exactly by \tex equal to |\vsize|. Consider a large |vbox| with lines of text, glue and penalties. The depth of this box, is the depth of the last component [80]. If the last component is a glue or penalty, the depth is zero. If it is a box, then its depth becomes the depth of the entire |\vbox|, except that it is limited to the value of parameter |\boxmaxdepth|.

If
|\boxmaxdepth=1pt| and the depth of the bottom box
is 1.94444pt, then the depth of the entire |\vbox|
will be 1pt and its height will be incremented
by .94444pt. This is equivalent to lowering the
reference point (or, equivalently, the baseline) of
the |\vbox| by .94444pt. In the plain format,
|\boxmaxdepth=\maxdimen| [348], so it has no effect
on the depths of boxes. However, |\boxmaxdepth|
can always be changed by the user \footnote{This \texttt{\textbackslash boxmaxdepth} setting is to ensure that deep footnotes do not overwrite the
footer (on account of the negative skip added later): it should use \texttt{\textbackslash @maxdepth}
otherwise the change is pointless when there are footnotes.
But see also its use when combining 
floats.  \latex uses a value of 5.5pt whereas plain a value of 4pt [348].}

%$$\sum_{n=1} a^2_3$$
%
%\the\maxdepth
%.....
%\showthe\pagedepth


If the last line on a page, contains letters that happen to not have any depth, the page depth will be zero. Try for example this:

\begin{teXXX}
....
\showthe\pagedepth
\bye
\end{teXXX}

You can also try it with a \latex minimal and will produce the same output.


\section{The height of a box of text}

Following the literature we denote the value of |\baselineskip| (which is normally 12pt) by $b$. 
A
large |\vbox| with text consists mainly of lines of
text, each an |\hbox|, separated by globs of glue,
normally in the (varying) amounts necessary to
separate baselines by exactly $b$, but sometimes just
the amount |\lineskip|. We assume a simple case
where no large characters or equations are used. In
such a case, all lines of text are separated by $b$. The
height of the box is thus:
\begin{gather}
b(n - 1) + \text{the height of the first line}
\end{gather}
where $n$ is the number of text lines. Remember that the first line is a special case and adjustments can be made using the value of |\topskip|.

\section{The height of \texttt{\textbackslash box255}}

In the case of |\box255|,
enough glue is placed above the first line of text
to reach to |\topskip| from the first baseline. We
denote the value of |\topskip| by $h$ (10pt in plain).
So if the baseline of the first line is now h below the
top of the page, the height H of |\box255| should
be b(n - 1) + h (Fig. 3). However, the height of
|\box255| is always set, by the page builder, to
|\vsize|. The difference between the two heights is
usually supplied by the flexible glues on the page,
the most common of which is |\parskip|

\begin{figure}[htp]
\includegraphics{./graphics/heightofpagebox}
\end{figure}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\Paragraph{Dead cycles.} An execution of the OTR without shipping any material is called a \texttt{dead cycle}. Dead cycles, have their uses and we will explain this a bit later on. However, long iterations that just return \textit{dead cycles} is an indication of an error somewhere. \tex counts the number of dead cycles in a counter named |\deadcycles| and stops the run if |\deadcycles >= \maxdeadcycles|.  In the \textit{plain} format |\maxdeadcycles| is set as 25 and in \latex as \the\deadcycles. |\maxdeadcycles = 100| is \the\maxdeadcycles. Each time |\shipout| is invoked, it resets |\deadcycles| to zero.

\begin{Code}
If the file is not included, reset \deadcycles, so that a long list of non-included
files does not generate an `Output loop' error.
115 \deadcycles\z@
116 \@nameuse{cp@#1}%
117 \fi
118 \let\@auxout\@mainaux}
\end{Code}


\Paragraph{\tex's Page Number.} The page number can come from any source. Salomon provides an example where the \textsc{OTR} typesets a page number from a |\count| variable. This is typeset centered below the printed area.

\begin{Code}
\newcount\pageNum
\output={
\shipout\vbox{
\box255\smallskip
\centerline{\tenrm\the\pageNum}}
\global\advance\pageNum by1}
\end{Code}

Notice that the output macro, just passes the contents of the box to |\shipout|. This is not actually a very good method, but is shown here to illustrate a point.

Note the |\tenrm| in the preceding example. It
is necessary because of the asynchronous nature of
the \otr. When the \otr is invoked, \tex can be
anywhere on the next page. Specifically, it could
be inside a group where a different font is used.
Without the |\tenrm|, that font (the current font)
would be used in the otr.
In the plain format, the |\count0| variable
serves as the page number, and the following two
macros are especially useful.
\end{multicols}


\begin{multicols}{2}
 \Paragraph{\S1021 The \texttt{\textbackslash vsplit} operation.} 
Supposed you have inserted the material required to go on a page on a big |\vbox|, but the material is a bit extra that what is required to fill a page exactly. You would need an operation to split the box in two. The |vsplit| operation does that. It is important to the understanding of OTR operations to have an intimate knowledge of |\vsplit|. Its syntax is: 

|\vsplit|\meta{box number} to \meta{dim}

The result of the operation is a box. Most often it appears in an assignment such as: |\setbox1=\vsplit0 to2.6in|. This sets |\box1| to a
height of 2.6in, moves material from the top of
|\box0| to |\box1|, and keeps the remainder in |\box0|.

It is important to remember that most of \tex's commands work with \latex as well. For example in the minimal below, we define a box to hold |lipsum| text. We can then split the box in so many lines.

\begin{Code}
% Split a box into two parts. The define a macro
% to hold the lines of text that are required.
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lipsum,multicol}
\begin{document}
\newbox\one
\newbox\two
\long\def\loremlines#1{\setbox\one=\vbox {\lipsum}
\setbox\two=\vsplit\one to #1\baselineskip
  \unvbox\two}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\small
\loremlines{16}
\end{multicols}
\end{document}
\end{Code}


\tex assumes that the new |\box1| may have to
be shipped out as part of the page. It therefore
places a glue similar to $h$ at the top of |\box1|.
This glue is called |\splittopskip| and has a plain
format value of 10pt [348].

One important thing to note is that a box can only be split \textit{between} lines of text. 
If we split a box to another size, |\box1| will come out underfull.

Here is an \otr which splits the page, ships
out the top part and returns the rest to the MVL
(actually, to the recent contributions):

\begin{Code}
\output={\setbox0=\vsplit255 to1in
\shipout\box0 \unvbox255}
\end{Code}


\end{multicols}



\section{Communicating with the OTR: Marks}

\begin{multicols}{2}
The user can pass information to the output routine through \textit{marks}. Marks have the syntax

\begin{teX}
\mark{mark text}
\end{teX}

which is put in a mark item on the current vertical list. The mark text is subject to expansion
as in \cmd{edef}.
If the mark is given in horizontal mode it migrates to the surrounding vertical lists like an
insertion item (see page Text By Topic 77); however, if this is not the external vertical list, the output routine
will not find the mark.

Marks are the main mechanism through which the output routine can obtain information
about the contents of the currently broken-off page, in particular its top and bottom. TEX sets
three variables:

{\obeylines
\cmd{botmark} the last mark occurring on the current page;
\cmd{firstmark} the first mark occurring on the current page;
\cmd{topmark} the last mark of the previous page, that is, the value of \cmd{botmark} on the previous
page.
}



If no marks have occurred yet, all three are empty; if no marks occured on the current pagr, all three variables are equal to the \cmd{botmark} of the previous page. 

Marks can be used to get a section heading into the headline or footline of the page.

\begin{verbatim}
\def\section#1{ ... \mark{#1} ... }
\def\rightheadline{\hbox to \hsize
    {\headlinefont \botmark\hfil\pagenumber}}
\def\leftheadline{\hbox to \hsize
   {\headlinefont \pagenumber\hfil\firstmark}}
\end{verbatim}

This places the title of the first section that starts on a left page in the left
headline, and the title of the last section that starts on the right page in
the right headline. Placing the headlines on the page is the job of the output
routine; see below.

It is important that no page breaks can occur in between the mark and the
box that places the title:

\emphasis{mark,nobreak}
\begin{teXXX}
\def\section#1{ ...
   \penalty\beforesectionpenalty
   \mark{#1}
   \hbox{ ... #1 ...}
   \nobreak
   \vskip\aftersectionskip
   \noindent}
\end{teXXX}
\end{multicols}



\section{Insertions}
Insertions are considered one of  the most  com- 
plex  topics in \tex. Many users master  topics  such 
as tokens,  file  I/O, macros,  and  even  OTRS  before 
they dare  tackle  insertions.  The  reason  is  that 
insertions  are  complex,  and  The \texbook, while 
covering all the relevant material, is somewhat cryp- 
tic regarding  insertions, and  lacks  simple examples. 
The  main  discussion  of  insertions takes  place  on 
[115-1251.  where \tex' s  registers  are also discussed. 
Examples  of  insertions are  shown, mostly  without 
explanations,  on  [363-364,  423-424].  A lot of what is described here is based on an article in TUGboat by David Salomon\footnote{ 
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30salomon.pdf}

Many users understand the idea of floats. Certain material to be typeset needs to be held in a buffer and inserted at different points on a page, for example a a figure that does not fit on a page it has to be inserted at the top of the next page. An \textit{insertion} is just a piece of a document that is generated at a certain point but appears at another point. Common examples are figures, footnotes and endnotes. Quoting Knuth:

\begin{quote}
  This  algorithm  is  admittedly  complicated, 
but  no  simpler  mechanism  seems  to  do  nearly 
as  much.
\end{quote}

\section{OTR Example}

\begin{figure}%
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.37\linewidth]{./graphics/framedpage}
  \caption{A boxed page}
  \label{fig:framedpage}
\end{figure}

Here is an OTR for a \textit{framed} page. It surrounds the
page with double rules on all sides, and centers the
page number below the double box. Note that the
page shipped out is wider and taller than \cmd{box255}.
The value of \cmd{hsize} in this case is, therefore, not
the width of the final page shipped out, but the
width of the text lines in \cmd{box255}.

Macro \cmd{frameit} typesets text and surrounds it
with 4 rules (see [Ex. 21.3]). Parameter \#2 is the
space between the rules and the text. \#1 is a box
containing the text.

\emphasis{output,shipout}
\begin{teXXX}
\def\frameit#1#2{%
 \vbox{\hrule
  \hbox{%
    \vrule \kern#2pt
      \vbox{\kern#2pt #1
         \kern#2pt}%
      \kern#2pt\vrule}
\hrule}}

\output={
   \shipout\vbox{
   \boxit{\frameit{\box255}9}
      \medskip
      \centerline{Test Framed Page}}
  \advancepageno}
\end{teXXX}


Plain TeX has an output routine that takes care of  simple things like page numbering and insertions
using \cmd{footnote} and \cmd{topinsert}. 

\section{\LaTeX\  output routines}

So far we have examined the \tex OTR in detail. I hope it has given you enough understanding, not only to write your own output routine, but also to now be ready to study the \latex output routine, which is much more complicated. We have so far seen that  when \tex 
is typesetting pages of continuous text, it will gather material until it can find a least-cost page break intended to
make the gathered material fit the \cmd{pagegoal size}. The
gathered material will then be placed into |\box255| and
the output routine stored in the token register \cmd{output}
will be processed in a group of its own. 

Usually it will
arrange the gathered material in some way, add headers,
footlines and page numbers, and ship the gathered results out in typeset form with the \cmd{shipout} command.
At the time of the \cmd{shipout} command all \cmd{open} and
\cmd{write} commands stored in the box shipped out are expanded and written out. This is what makes it possible to have page labels corresponding to the actual page
numbers at the time of shipout: the corresponding info
is written to the |.aux| file at that time.
The output routine may decide to place material
back on the main vertical list instead of shipping it out.

\LaTeX\ output routine is described in \texttt{ltoutput.dtx}. You should also have a look at \texttt{ltfloat.dtx}. The algorithm is revisited i \latex3 and Frank Mittelbach, published a paper
\footnote{\protect\url{http://www.latex-project.org/papers/xo-pfloat.pdf}} in which he explains some of the problems facing the team, when dealing with the output routine.


Information on the output routine is rather scarce. Best source is a series of  articles in the TUGBoat by David Salomon.

Part III: Insertions}

\href{http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb15-1/tb42salomon-output.pdf}{Output routines: Examples and techniques Part IV: Horizontal techniques}


David Kastrup's article \href{http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-3/kastrup.pdf}{Output Routine Requirements for Advanced Typesetting Tasks} (Proceedings of EuroTEX 2003) otlined some of the difficult areas and specifications for generic routines

The standard blocks are well described above and most tasks could be accomplished 
by rather working from
standard building blocks like \textit{insertion lists}, \textit{here points},
default mechanisms for \textit{margin notes} and so on.


\section*{Calling the output routine}

The output routine is called either by TeX's normal page-breaking
mechanism, or by a macro putting a penalty < or = -10000 in the output
list. In the latter case, the penalty indicates why the output
routine was called, using the following code.
penalty reason

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
penalty &reason\\
\midrule
-10000  &\ pagebreak\\
~       &\ newpage\\
-10001  &clearpage (\ penalty -10000 \ vbox{}| \ penalty -10001)|\\
-10002  &float insertion, called from horizontal mode\\
-10003 &float insertion, called from vertical mode.\\
-10004 &float insertion.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\medskip

Note: A |float| or |marginpar| puts the following sequence in the output
list: 

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item a penalty of -10004,

\item a null |\vbox|

\item a penalty of -10002 or -10003.
\end{enumerate}

This solves two special problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the float comes right after a |\newpage| or |\clearpage|,
then the first penalty is ignored, but the second one
invokes the output routine.

\item If there is a split footnote on the page, the second 'page'
puts out the rest of the footnote
\end{enumerate}

\latex first defines some helper routines and increase the \cmd{maxdeadcycles}. The helper macros are for
manipulating lisst.

\begin{Code}
7 \maxdeadcycles = 100
8 \let\@elt\relax
9 \def\@next#1#2#3#4{\ifx#2\@empty #4\else
10 \expandafter\@xnext #2\@@#1#2#3\fi}
\@next \CS \LIST {NONEMPTY}{EMPTY} == %% NOTE: ASSUME
\@elt = \relax
BEGIN assume that \LIST == \@elt \B1 ... \@elt \Bn
if n = 0
then EMPTY
else \CS :=L \B1
\LIST :=G \@elt \B2 ... \@elt \Bn
NONEMPTY
fi
END

\end{Code}


\begin{Code}
11 \def\@xnext \@elt #1#2\@@#3#4{\def#3{#1}\gdef#4{#2}}

12 \def\@testfalse{\global\let\if@test\iffalse}
13 \def\@testtrue {\global\let\if@test\iftrue}
14 \@testfalse}
   }

15 \def\@bitor#1#2{\@testfalse {\let\@elt\@xbitor
16   \@tempcnta #1\relax #2}}

17 \def\@xbitor #1{\@tempcntb \count#1
18    \ifnum \@tempcnta =\z@
19    \else
20      \divide\@tempcntb\@tempcnta
21    \ifodd\@tempcntb \@testtrue\fi
22   \fi}
\end{Code}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\Paragraph{Float boxes and lists.} 
A \textit{float list} consisting of the 
floats in boxes |\boxa ... \boxN| has
the form:

|\@elt \boxa ... \@elt \boxN|
where |\boxI| is defined by

|\newinsert\boxI|

Normally, |\@elt| is |\let| to |\relax|. A test can be performed on the
entire 
oat list by locally |\def|'ing |\@elt| appropriately and
executing the list.
This is a lot more efficient than looping through the list.
\LaTeX\ defines float boxes as |bx@A| to |bx@R| to make them available for 
inserts. These will be used later to define the lists that hold these boxes. 


\latex now defines the float boxes. Each one is defined as an insert.
\begin{Code}
\newinsert\bx@A
...
\newinsert\bx@I
\newinsert\bx@J
\newinsert\bx@K
\newinsert\bx@L
\newinsert\bx@M
\newinsert\bx@N
\newinsert\bx@O
\newinsert\bx@P
\newinsert\bx@Q
\newinsert\bx@R
\end{Code}


\end{multicols}
Once these boxes are defined they are inserted in the |@freelist|. At this point all the other lists are defined.

\emphasis{@freelist,@toplist,@botlist,@midlist,@currlist}
\begin{Code}
41 \gdef\@freelist{\@elt\bx@A\@elt\bx@B\@elt\bx@C\@elt\bx@D\@elt\bx@E
42                 \@elt\bx@F\@elt\bx@G\@elt\bx@H\@elt\bx@I\@elt\bx@J
43                 \@elt\bx@K\@elt\bx@L\@elt\bx@M\@elt\bx@N
44                 \@elt\bx@O\@elt\bx@P\@elt\bx@Q\@elt\bx@R}
\end{Code}

All the lists are defined initially to be empty.
\begin{Code}
45 \gdef\@toplist{}
46 \gdef\@botlist{}
47 \gdef\@midlist{}
48 \gdef\@currlist{}
49 \gdef\@deferlist{}
50 \gdef\@dbltoplist{}
51 \gdef\@dbldeferlist{}
\end{Code}


The lists are similar to those defined in \texttt{plain}.

\begin{description}
\item[\string\@freelist] : List of empty boxes for placing new 
floats.
\item[\string\@toplist] : List of 
floats to go at top of current column.
\item[\string\@midlist] : List of 
floats in middle of current column.
\item[\string\@botlist] : List of 
floats to go at bottom of current column.
\item[\string\@deferlist] : List of 
floats to go after current column.
\item[\string\@dbltoplist] : List of double-col. 
floats to go at top of current

\item[\string\@dbldeferlist] : List of double-column 
floats to go on subsequent
pages.

\end{description}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Check was prudent when defining the newinsert boxes in order to reserve space and memory. The package \docpkg{morefloats} can be used to add more floats to this list. This should have definitely been included here in a revision.

\Paragraph{Defining Layout parameters} All the page layout parameters are defined next. 

\begin{Code}
52 \newdimen\topmargin
53 \newdimen\oddsidemargin
54 \newdimen\evensidemargin
55 \let\@themargin=\oddsidemargin
56 \newdimen\headheight
57 \newdimen\headsep

63 \newdimen\columnseprule
64 \newdimen\marginparwidth
65 \newdimen\marginparsep
66 \newdimen\marginparpush
\end{Code}

Remember  that TeX knows littel about a page. The problem is that TEX has no idea how
wide and tall the paper is. All it knows is the
left and top offsets, and the dimensions of the
printed area (|\hsize| and |\vsize|). All these dimensions need to be calculated and adjustments made within the \otr.

A document normally  starts by specifying:

\begin{Code}

\subsection*{The AtBeginDvi}
A box register is used  to put stuff that must appear before anything else
in the |.dvi| file.

The stuff in the box should not add any typeset material to the page when it
is unboxed.

\emphasis{AtBeginDvi,@begindvibox}

\begin{teXXX}
67 \newbox\@begindvibox
68 \def \AtBeginDvi #1{%
69 \global \setbox \@begindvibox
70 \vbox{\unvbox \@begindvibox #1}%
71 }
\end{teXXX}

\begin{Code}
72 \newdimen\@maxdepth
73 \@maxdepth = \maxdepth
\end{Code}


Some new registers for paperheight and paperwidth are defined:

\begin{Code}
74 \newdimen\paperheight
75 \newdimen\paperwidth
76 \newif \if@insert
These should definitely be global:
77 \newif \if@fcolmade
78 \newif \if@specialpage \@specialpagefalse
These should be global but are not always set globally in other les.
79 \newif \if@firstcolumn \@firstcolumntrue
80 \newif \if@twocolumn \@twocolumnfalse
Not sure about these: two questions. Should things which must apply to a whole
doument be local or global (they probably should be `preamble only' commands)?
Are these three such things?
81 \newif \if@twoside \@twosidefalse
82 \newif \if@reversemargin \@reversemarginfalse
83 \newif \if@mparswitch \@mparswitchfalse
This counter has been imported from `multicol'.
84 \newcount \col@number
85 \col@number \@ne
\end{Code}

and a lot of other internal registers

\begin{multicols}{2}
\Paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash clearpage}}. The clearpage macro is a bit complicated, as it needs to avoid a complete empty page after a |\twocolumn[..]|. This prevents the text from the argument
vanishing into a 
oat box, never to be seen again. We hope that it does not
produce wrong formatting in other cases.

\begin{Code}
106 \def\clearpage{%
107 \ifvmode
108 \ifnum \@dbltopnum =\m@ne
109 \ifdim \pagetotal <\topskip
110 \hbox{}%
111 \fi
112 \fi
113 \fi
114 \newpage
115 \write\m@ne{}%
116 \vbox{}%
117 \penalty -\@Mi
118 }
\end{Code}

\Paragraph{The \texttt{\textbackslash clearpagedoublepage} macro} checks for odd and even pages by using the
page counter |c@page|.  It also provides switches of twoside printing. \TODO{Why not from auxiliary?}

\begin{Code}
119 \def\cleardoublepage{\clearpage\if@twoside \ifodd\c@page\else
120 \hbox{}\newpage\if@twocolumn\hbox{}\newpage\fi\fi\fi}
\end{Code}

Note the |\newpage| is defined a bit further on. This is a fairly simple definition, since most of the code that follows only gets a bit complicated with the twocolumn option. It sets the dimensions and the booleans to those appropriate for the |onecolumn| option. An important note we back to \tex's |\hsize|. Both the linewidth as well as the columnwidth are set to this.

\begin{Code}
123 \def\onecolumn{%
124   \clearpage
125   \global\columnwidth\textwidth
126   \global\hsize\columnwidth
127   \global\linewidth\columnwidth
128   \global\@twocolumnfalse
129   \col@number \@ne
130   \@floatplacement
     }
\end{Code}

\Paragraph{\string newpage.} The |\newpage| macro is programmed defensively. The two checks at the beginning ensure that an item label or run-in section title
immediately before a |\newpage| get printed on the correct page, the one before
the page break.
All three tests are largely to make error processing more robust; that is why
they all reset the 
flags explicitly, even when it would appear that this would be
done by a |\leavevmode|.

\begin{Code}
131 \def \newpage {%
132  \if@noskipsec
133    \ifx \@nodocument\relax
134      \leavevmode
135      \global \@noskipsecfalse
136    \fi
137 \fi
138 \if@inlabel
139   \leavevmode
140   \global \@inlabelfalse
141 \fi
142 \if@nobreak \@nobreakfalse \everypar{}\fi
143 \par
144 \vfil
145 \penalty -\@M}
\end{Code}

An empty cols is defined. There is a note here, that an invisible rule might have been a better idea.

\begin{Code}
146 \def \@emptycol {\vbox{}\penalty -\@M}
\end{Code}

\Paragraph{The \string twocolumn macro.} This is the longest definition so far. We will leave it for a while and then come back. There are several bug fixes to the two-column stuff here. Firstly, like the onecolumn the page parameters are set to the correct parameters.


\begin{Code}
147 \def \twocolumn {%
148 \clearpage
149 \global\columnwidth\textwidth
150 \global\advance\columnwidth-\columnsep
151 \global\divide\columnwidth\tw@

\section*{The output macro}
The setting of the \cmd{output} is quite short but it belies its complexity.
After having checked verious parameters it redirects to |@specialoutput|. This is the heart of the routines. Notice that \latex just fills in the token list of \tex's |output| routine, it does not attempt to redefine it or save it. 
Should some hooks be defined here, life might have been made easier, however, what one can do is to first save the \latex output routine and then redefine the output as one may wish. Return to it can happen after it. If you take this approach, you should be careful of packages that redefine output, such as |multicol| and |longtable|. An approach such as this is taken by |revtex|.

\Paragraph{The \string @doclearpage macro.} This is an emergency action. It dumps everything: footnotes first and then floats. 



\section*{The Kludgeins}

\begin{multicols}{2}
The kludgeins are simply inserts that fool \tex in enlarging a page by a small amount, normally used to allow one or two lines of text to go in the same page.

The two kludgeins mentioned in the kernel are are \cmd{enlargethisspace} and its star version.\footnote{The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed., 1989) kludge entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition, and etymology: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article, which appeared in the American computer magazine Datamation
kludge  Also kluge. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also bodge v., fudge v.]

'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in Computing, a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'.

The word 'kludge' is...derived from the same root as the German Kluge..., originally meaning 'smart' or 'witty'.... 'Kludge' eventually came to mean 'not so smart' or 'pretty ridiculous'.} 

So how \latex achieves to enlarge the page? Once the dimensions and textheight has been set by the user, the command communicates the extra amount by using and |insert|. The insert which makes TEX do a lot of the necessary work. All we need to put
into it is the amount by which the pagegoal should be changed


\begin{Code}
\gdef \enlargethispage{%
1198 \@ifstar
1199 {%
1203   \@enlargepage{\hbox{\kern\p@}}}%

1208   \@enlargepage\@empty}%

1221 \@latexerr{Suggested\space extra\space height\space

1228 h=tracei
1229 \@bsphack
1230 \insert\@kludgeins{#1\vskip-\@tempskipa}%
1231 \@esphack
This next bit is for tracing only:
1232 h*tracei
1233 \ifvmode \par
1234 \tr@ce {Kludgeins added--pagegoal after: \the \pagegoal}%
1235 \fi

1242 }
1243 h=2ekernel j def1i
\end{Code}

Adds |<dim>| to the height of the current column only. On the printed page the
bottom of this column is extended downwards by exactly |<dim>| without having
any effect on the placement of the footer; this may result in an overprinting.
|\enlargethispage*{<dim>}}}|.

Similar to |\enlargethispage| but it tries to squeeze the column to be printed
in as small a space as possible, ie it uses any shrinkability in the column. If the
column was not explicitly broken (e.g. with |\pagebreak|) this may result in an
overfull box message but except for this it will come out as expected (if you know
what to expect).

The star form of this command is dedicated to Leslie Lamport, the other we
need for ourselves (FMi, CAR).
These commands may well have unwanted if used soon before a

\section{Float Placement Parameters}


\begin{multicols}{2}
The main purpose of this section is to ensure that all the 
float-placement parameters
which need to be set in a class file or package have been declared. It
also describes their use and sets values for them which are reasonable for typical
douments using US letter or A4 sized paper. These are more readable. If the values are reasonable, can depend on the type of publication you are using and the size and shape of the floats. Generally, I prefer to have pages with less white-spae than that allowed in the standard defaults and this is discussed in more detail under the section on typography.

\let\Lpack\docpkg



\section{Using packages to ease the pain}

OTR routines are notoriously difficult to debug and define. Some of the available packages at CTAN
can make the programming job easier.

The |everypage| package by Sergio Callegari provides hooks into the \latex\ internal commands to
to do actions on every page or on the current page. Specifically, actions  are performed \emph{before} the page is shipped, so they can be
used to put watermarks \emph{in the background} of a page, or to
set the page layout. 

The package provides two hooks:

\emphasis{AddEverypageHook,AddThisPageHook}
\begin{teXXX}
  \AddEverypageHook{Test}
  \AddThisPageHook
\end{teXXX}

The package reminds in some sense
\docpkg{bobhook} by Karsten Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in
 which the hooks are implemented, as detailed in the following.
 In some sense it may also be related to the package
 \docpkg{everyshi} by Martin Schroeder, but again the implementation
 is different.

 
 This program adds two \LaTeX\ hooks that get run when document
 pages are finalized and output to the |.dvi| or |.pdf|
 file. Specifically, one hook gets executed on every page, while the
 other is executed for the current page. Hook actions are are performed
 \emph{before} the page is output on the medium, and this is
 important to be able to play with the page layout or to put things
 \emph{behind} the page contents (e.g., watermarks such as an image,
 framing, the ``DRAFT'' word, and the like).
 
 The package reminds in some sense \Lpack{bobhook} by Karsten
 Tinnefeld, but it differs in the way in which the hooks are
 implemented:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item there is no formatting inherent in the hooks. If one wants to
   put some watermark on a page, it is his own duty to put in the
   hook the code to place the watermark in the right position. Also
   note that the hooks code should \emph{eat up no space} in the
   page.  Again, if the hooks are meant to place some material on the
   page, it is the duty of the hook programmer to put code in the
   hooks to pretend that the material has zero width and zero height.
   The implementation is \emph{lighter} than the \Lpack{bobhook} one,
   and possibly more flexible, since one is not limited by any
   pre-coded formatting for the hooks. On the other hand it is
   possibly more difficult to use. Nonetheless, it is easy to think
   of other packages relying on \Lpack{everypage} to deliver more
   user-friendly and \emph{task specific} interfaces. Already there
   are a couple of them: the package \Lpack{flippdf} produces
   mirrored pages in a PDF document and \Lpack{draftwatermark}
   watermarks document pages.
 \item similarly to \Lpack{bobhook} and \Lpack{watermark}, the
   package relies on the manipolatoin of the internal \LaTeX\ macro
   |\@begindvi| to do the job. However, the redefinition of
   |\@begindvi| is here postponed as much as possible, striving to
   avoid interference with other packages using |\AtBeginDvi| or
   anyway manipulating |\@begindvi|. Specifically \Lpack{everypage}
   makes no special assumption on the initial code that |\@begindvi|
   might contain.
 \end{enumerate}



Also in some sense \Lpack{everypage} can be related to package
 \Lpack{everyshi} by Martin Schroeder, but it differs radically from
 it in the implementation. In fact,\Lpack{everypage} operates by
 manipulation of the |\@begindvi| macro, rather than at the
 lower level |shipout| macro.


\section{How to place a background image}

One can use TikZ to place a background image on a page

First we define some utility macros:
\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./graphics/draftpage}
  \captionof{figure}{A boxed page}
  \label{fig:draftpage}
\end{marginfigure}


\begin{teXXX}
  \def\bg@contents{Draft}
  \def\bg@color{red!45}
  \def\bg@angle{60}
  \def\bg@opacity{.5}
  \def\bg@scale{15}
  \def\bg@position{current page.center}
  \def\bg@anchor{}
  \def\bg@hshift{0}
  \def\bg@vshift{0}
\end{teXXX}

A new command is then developed to describe the background material

\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand\bg@material{%
   \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
   \node [rotate=\bg@angle,scale=\bg@scale,opacity=\bg@opacity,%
   xshift=\bg@hshift,yshift=\bg@vshift,color=\bg@color]
   at (\bg@position) [\bg@anchor] {\bg@contents};
  \end{tikzpicture}}%
\end{verbatim}

Once the background material has been defined we can place it on the page by simply calling

\begin{teXXX}
   \newcommand\BgThispage{\AddThispageHook{\bg@material}}
\end{teXXX}

The background package has capitalized on two good packages the TikZ and the everypage. Similarly you can use your own ingenuity to design whatever you want


\section{hooking at shipout}
\let\package\docpkg
\let\cs\doccmd

This package provides the hooks \cmd{EveryShipout} and 
  \cmd{AtNextShipout} whose arguments are executed after the output 
  routine has constructed \cmd{box255}, and before \cmd{shipout} is 
  called.

  An example application for this package would be a package for
  adding text to the bottom of each page.
  Such a package does exist: \docpkg{prelim2e}\cite{package!prelim2e}.

The solution  uses is based on code developed in  \textsf{quire.tex} by
 Marcel R.~van der Goot.  It is based upon \cs{afterassignment} and \cmd{aftergroup}.



A bit of a diversion here is necessary to describe what the command \cmd{afterassignment} does
We will us the example from the TeXbook (exercise 11.5). The example requires
the construction of  a \cmd{demobox} macro for use in writing manuals like this, so that an
author can write `\cmd{demobox}\{Tough exercise.\}'.

\cmd{afterassignment}. The token is saved in a special place; it will be
inserted back into the input just after the next assignment command has been performed.
An assignment need not follow immediately; if another \cmd{afterassignment} is
performed before the next assignment, the second one overrides the first. 

If the next
assignment is a \cmd{setbox}, and if the assigned hboxi is \cmd{hbox} or \cmd{vbox} or \cmd{vtop}, the
\meta{token} will be inserted just after the \{ in the box construction, not after the\}; it will
also come just before any tokens inserted by \cmd{everyhbox} or \cmd{everyvbox}.

\cmd{aftergroup}. The token is saved on TEX's stack; it will be inserted
back into the input just after the current group has been completed and its local
assignments have been undone. If several \cmd{aftergroup} commands occur in the same
group, the corresponding commands will be scanned in the same order; for example,

\begin{teXX}
{\aftergroup\a\aftergroup\b} yields \a\b.
\end{teXX}

%surrounded by a pair of braces, making it into a
