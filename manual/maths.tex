You can start writing mathematical text, without any additional loading of packages, either in plain \tex or \latex. The reality is that most institutions have developed their own styles and common packages used by AMS have found widespread use. We will discussing these extensively, but first let us look at how to enter mathematical text. 

To enter mathematical text in plain \tex you just use the |$|\ldots|$| for inline math and |$$|\ldots|$$| for displayed math. We now illustrate, the usage with and example.

\section{Inline and Display Math}
Mathematical typesetting involves either inline math formulae, which are part of a paragraph of text or display math which are a block of mathematical material. \tex will typeset inline math by enclosing the material between 
\$...\$. 
\bigskip

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{TeX style inline and display math},width=0.75\textwidth}
This is an inline equation $a^2+b^2=c^2$

And this equation is a display equation:
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
\end{tcblisting}
\bigskip

The above code, is valid in \latex and its variants as well. However in certain cases, especially for displayed math, this can introduce some blank lines. Lamport redefined
the \$\$. For inline math use |\(...\)| and for display math |\[...\] |. The above example can be written as:
\bigskip

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Basic Definitions,width=0.75\textwidth}
This is an inline equation \(a^2+b^2=c^2\)

And this equation is a display equation:
\[a^2+b^2=c^2\]

\begin{math}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{1}{2}n\cdot(n+1)
\end{math}
\end{tcblisting}
\bigskip


As you can observe the output remains the same.  Spaces within  maths environment are ignored, so use this to your advantage when writing maths. As mentioned earlier, we can use |\[...\]| for display math.

We can now try a rather longer example, before getting into more details:
\begin{shaded}
\begin{teXXX}
\[ \sum a_1+a_2+\dots a_n \]
\end{teXXX}
\[ \sum a_1+a_2+\dots a_n \]
\end{shaded}

\section{Displayed Equations}
Displayed equations, can either be displayed \emph{flushed left} or \emph{centered}, depending on the option loaded with the standard classes, for example in article use

\begin{teX}
\documentclass[imperial,11pt,openany, twoside,fleqn]{octavo}[2005/09/16]
\end{teX}

We will see, how to change the formatting a bit later on.

\section{Greek letters}

Mathematicians and Engineers, quickly run out of symbols to use with their equations and hence use Greek letters. All
the Greek letters are available in \tex{} 

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
\toprule
$\alpha$  &\doccmd{alpha} &$\beta$ &\doccmd{beta} &$\gamma$ &\doccmd{gamma} &$\delta$ &\doccmd{delta}\\
$\epsilon$  &\doccmd{epsilon} &$\varepsilon$ &\doccmd{varepsilon} &$\zeta$ &\doccmd{zeta} &$\eta$ &\doccmd{eta}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



Sometimes accents are put above or below symbols. The control words used for accents
in mathematics are different from those used for normal text. The normal text control words
may not be used for mathematics and vice-versa.\sidenote{\texbook 135-136 }. See also
\href{mathmode.pdf}{http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf}

\section{Fractions}

There are two ways of typesetting a fraction in \tex{}: it can be typeset as $1/4$ or in the form $\frac{1}{4}$. The first case is entered with no special control characters that is,  \verb+ $1/2$+. The second case is just entered with the control word \cmd{over}.  Hence\verb+ ${1} \over {4}$+ gives ${1} \over {4}$. \LaTeX\ provides a macro \cmd{frac}.

A more complex example,

\begin{teX}
\[
a+\gamma \over \delta^2
\]
\end{teX}

\[a+\gamma \over \delta^2\]

One complication with using maths in-line with text is that of using different type of fonts. There is a very useful and interesting discussion in the package \pkg{xfrac}. 

 One of the first exercises in \emph{The \TeX Book} is to design a
 macro for split level fractions. The solution presented is fairly
  simple, using a \emph{virgule} (a slash) for separating the two
  components. It looks okay because the text font and math font of
  Computer Modern look almost identical.\index{virgule}

  The proper symbol to use instead of the virgule is a \emph{solidus}\sidenote{The solidus (/) \index{solidus} is a punctuation mark used to indicate fractions including fractional currency. It may also be called a shilling mark, an in-line fraction bar, or a fraction slash. Its Unicode encoding is \texttt{U+2044}.

The solidus is similar to another punctuation mark, the slash, which is found on standard keyboards; the slash is closer to being vertical than the solidus. These are two distinct symbols that traditionally have entirely different uses. However, many people no longer distinguish between them, and when there is no alternative it is acceptable to use the slash in place of the solidus.
Both the ISO and Unicode designate the solidus as \texttt{FRACTION SLASH U+2044} and the slash as \texttt{SOLIDUS U+002F}. This contradicts long-established English typesetting terminology (See Bringhurst.}
  which does not exist in Computer Modern. It is however available in
  the European Computer Modern fonts, but I'll get back to that.

  The most common way to produce split level fractions within \LaTeX\
  is by means of the \docpkg{nicefrac} package. Part of the reason it
  has found widespread use is due to the strange design of the
  built-in text fractions of the EC fonts, which look like this:
  \textonehalf. The package is very simple to use but there are a few
  issues:

 \begin{itemize}
  \item It uses the virgule instead of the solidus.
  \item Font size of numerator and denominator is bigger than in the
    built-in symbol. Compare Palatino: \switch{ppl}{\nicefrac{1}{2}}
    vs. \switch{ppl}{\textonehalf }. (\sfrac{1}{2})

  \item It doesn't correct for fonts using text figures such as in the
    \docpkg{eco} package. Compare \switch{cmor}{\nicefrac{1}{2}} and
    \switch{cmor}{\nicefrac{8}{9}}.
  \item In math mode, it doesn't always pick up the correct math
    alphabet.
 \end{itemize}
 In short: \docpkg{nicefrac} doesn't attempt to be the answer to
 everything and so this is not a criticism of the package. It works
 quite well for Computer Modern which was pretty much what was widely
 available at the time it was developed. Users these days, however,
 have a choice of many fonts when they write their documents.

With |xfrac| we can switch fonts easily

 ``You take \sfrac[cmr2]{1}{2} cup of sugar, \ldots''




\section{Square roots}

The square root sign, which historically derived from a dot is now simply typeset a square root it is only necessary to use the construction \cmd{sqrt}. Hence

\begin{teX}
$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
\end{teX}

will give $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$


Notice that \tex takes care of the placement of
symbols and the height and length of the radical. To make cube or other roots, the control
words \cmd{root} and \cmd{of} are used. You get $\root n \of {1+x^n}$ from the input 

\begin{teX}
   $\root n \of  {1+x^n}$ 
\end{teX}

A possible alternative is to use the control word \cmd{surd}; the input \verb+ $\surd 2$+ will
produce $\surd 2$.

When typesetting square roots care should be taken, to use struts appropriately to get the sizing right.

\section{Trigonometric and other Functions}
There are several types of functions that appear frequently in mathematical text. In
an equation like $\sin2x+\cos2x=1$ the trigonometric functions \cmd{sin} and \cmd{cos} are in
roman rather than italic type. This is the usual mathematical convention to indicate that
it is a function being described and not the product of three variables. The control words
\doccmd{sin} and \doccmd{cos} will use the right typeface automatically. Here is a table of these and some
other special functions:

\begin{teX}
\sin \cos \tan \cot \sec \csc \arcsin \arccos
\arctan \sinh \cosh \tanh \coth \lim \sup \inf
\limsup \liminf \log \ln \lg \exp \det \deg
\dim \hom \ker \max \min \arg \gcd \Pr
\end{teX}

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{TeX style inline and display math},width=0.75\textwidth}
\[ \cos(2\theta) = 2 \cos^{2}2 \theta-1\]
\end{tcblisting}

Functions that are missing from a basic instllation can be either defined or one can use one of the many packages that supplement the above.

\section{Using special symbols}

Special symbols such as dingbats loaded using the |pifont| package need to be encloded within an |\mbox| in order to be able to display the glyph properly.
\bigskip

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{DINGBATS},width=0.9\textwidth}
\label{e14}
 We start by showing that the function $f(x)=x^2$ is
continuous over the set $X_2$\label{p:X2} defined as the interval
$[0,1]$ where numerals $\frac{i}{\mbox{\ding{172}}}, 0 \le i \le
\mbox{\ding{172}},$ are used to express its points in units $\mu$.
First of all, note that the set $X_2$ is continuous in   $\mu$
because its points are equidistant with the distance
$d=\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-1}$. Since this function is strictly
increasing,  to show its continuity it is sufficient to check the
difference $f(x)-f(x^{-})$ at the point $x=1$. In this case,
$x^{-}=1-\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-1}$ and we have
\[
 f(1)-f(1-\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-1})=
 1-(1-\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-1})^2 =
 2\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-1}(-1)\mbox{\ding{172}}^{-2}.
\]
This number is infinitesimal, thus $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous over
the set $X_2$. \hfill $\Box$
\end{tcblisting}
\bigskip

\cs{Box}
Notice the use of the |\Box| command to draw a square for  end of proof symbol. This is from the amsmath package. The box is placed at the end of the line using |\hfill $\Box$|.



\section{Partial derivatives}

Partial derivatives can be typeset using the \latex{} command \cmd{partial}
\begin{teXX}
\[
 \sqrt{\frac{x^2}{k+1}}\qquad
  x^\frac{2}{k+1}\qquad
  \frac{\partial^2f}
  {\partial x^2}
\]
\end{teXX}




\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{k+1}}\qquad
x^\frac{2}{k+1}\qquad
\frac{\partial^2f}
{\partial x^2}
\end{equation*}


\newthought{Binomial Coefficients}

To typeset binomial coefficients or similar structures, use the command
\cmd{binom} from \docpkg{amsmath}:\index{amsmath!binom}

Pascal's rule can be typeset as:

\begin{shaded}
\begin{teXX}
\[
\binom{n}{k} =\binom{n-1}{k}
+ \binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]
\end{teXX}
\[
\binom{n}{k} =\binom{n-1}{k}
+ \binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]
\end{shaded}

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{X} = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1 & x_2 & \ldots \\
x_3 & x_4 & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array} \right)
\end{equation*}

\end{vmatrix}.
\end{gather*}


\section{Displayed equations}
All of the mathematics covered so far has identical input whether it is to be typeset
in-line or displayed. At this point we’ll look at some situations that apply to displayed
equations only.





\section{Single equations that are too long}

In many cases equations need to be written over two or more lines. The \docpkg{amsmath} package, provides an environment that is suitable for this:

\emphasis{cos}
\begin{teXXX}
\begin{multline}
   a + b + c + d + e + f+ g + h + i  + k + l + m + n + o + p\\
              = j + k + l + m + n +\cos^{2}-1
\end{multline}
\end{teXXX}

\begin{multline}
a + b + c + d + e + f+ g + h + i  + k + l + m + n + o + p\\
= j + k + l + m + n +\cos^{2}-1
\end{multline}

\newpage
\section{array environment}
This is simply the same as the eqnarray environment only with the possibility of
variable rows and columns and the fact, that the whole formula has only one
equation number and that the array environment can only be part of another math
environment, like the equation environment or the displaymath environment. With
@{} before the first and after the last column the additional space |\arraycolsep| is
not used, which maybe important when using left aligned equations.

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The egnarray Environment},width=1.05\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray}
a & = & b + c \\
& = & d + e + f + g + h + i
+ j + k + l \nonumber \\
&& +\: m + n + o \\
& = & p + q + r + s
\end{eqnarray}
\end{tcblisting}



the equations
to be aligned are entered with each one terminated by \doccmd{cr}. In each equation there should be
one alignment symbol \& to indicate where the alignment should take place. This is usually
done at the equal signs, although it is not necessary to do so. For example

\verb*+ \qquad( )+ produce

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The array Environment},width=1.05\textwidth}
Thus to change $\frac34$ to a decimal divide $4$ into $3$
and we get $.75$ as a result, thus:
\[
\begin{array}{r@{}r@{}}
4 \; & \vline \; 3.00 \\\cline{2-2}
     &            .75
\end{array}
\]

To find the square root of a four-figure number
such as our example calls for, work it out in the
following manner:
\[
\arraycolsep=0em
\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\text{2d pair}} &\qquad&\qquad&
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\text{1st pair}}&\qquad&\qquad&
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\text{square root}}\\
 & \overbrace{\quad}&\ZZZ&&&\ZZZ&\overbrace{\quad}&\ZZZ\\
 & 42 &&&&& 25 &&&&\vline\;65&(answer)\\\cline{11-11}
 & 36 &&&&& \\\cline{2-2}
\multirow{2}{*}{125\:} & \vline\hfill \Z6 \hfill&&&&& 25\\
 & \vline\hfill \Z6 \hfill&&&&& 25\\\cline{2-7}
\end{array}
\]

\end{tcblisting}

\subsection{Array environment in game theory}
This example is from \footnote{From determinacy to Nash equilibrium,St\'ephane Le Roux, TU Darmstadt }
\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The array Environment},width=1.05\textwidth}
The game $\langle\{a,b,c\},\{1,2,3,4\}^3,\{0,1,2,3,4\},v,(<_d)_{d\in\{a,b,c\}}\rangle$ is represented below, where player $a$ chooses the row, $b$ the column, and $c$ the array. 
\[\begin{array}{c@{\hspace{1cm}}c@{\hspace{1cm}}c@{\hspace{1cm}}c}
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
\hline 4 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 1 & 2 & 1 & 1\\
\hline 2 & 2 & 2 & 2\\
\hline 1 & 2 & 1 & 1\\
\hline 4 & 2 & 1 & 1\\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 1 & 1 & 3 & 1\\
\hline 1 & 1 & 3 & 1\\
\hline 3 & 3 & 3 & 3\\
\hline 4 & 1 & 3 & 1\\
\hline
\end{array}
&
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 2 & 4 & 4 & 4\\
\hline 4 & 3 & 4 & 4\\
\hline 4 & 4 & 4 & 4\\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{array}
\]
Let us show that the game $\langle\{a,b,c\},\{1,\dots,n\}^3,\{0,\dots,n\},v,(<_d)_{d\in\{a,b,c\}}\rangle$ witnesses the claim. First, the preferences are linear orders indeed. Second, let us show that there is no Nash equilibrium by case-splitting below. 
\end{tcblisting}

\section{The AMSmath Package}

The amsmath package offers four different align environments, align, alignat, falign, xalignat and xxalignat. In difference to the eqnarray environment from standard LATEX the ``three'' parts of one equation expr.-symbol-expr. are divided by only one
ampersand in two parts. In general the ampersand should be before the symbol
to get the right spacing, e.g., y \&= x. 

\subsection{The align environment}

The align environment is an improvement over \latex's eqnarray environment. It is very similar to a tabular
environment and is aligned at the |&|.

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The Align Environment},width=1.05\textwidth}
\begin{align}
         y & =d\label{eq:IntoSection}\\
         y & =cx+d\\
 y_{12} & =bx^{2}+cx+d\\
     y(x) & =ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d
 \end{align}

\begin{align*}
\therefore (13 - x_1) + (13 - x_2) + \dotsb + (13 - x_p) + r &= 52\,,\\
\therefore 13p - (x_1 + x_2 + \dotsb + x_p) + r              &= 52\,,\\
\therefore x_1 + x_2 + \dotsb + x_p                          &= 13p - 52 + r\\
                                                          &= 13 (p - 4) + r\,.
\end{align*}

whence we conclude that $\gamma$ is a primitive root modulo $p$. But
\begin{align*}
\gamma^{p-1}-1 &=
     g^{p-1} - 1 + \frac{p-1}{1!}g^{p-2}xp +
        \frac{(p-1)(p-2)}{2!}g^{p-3}x^2p^2 + \ldots \\
  &= p\left(kp + \frac{p-1}{1!}g^{p-2}x +
        \frac{(p-1)(p-2)}{2!}g^{p-3}x^2p + \ldots\right).
\end{align*}
\end{tcblisting}

\subsection{The aligned environment}
The aligned environment allows more than one horizontal alignment but has only one equation number.
\newcommand{\dotsb}{\ldots}			% use lower dots after +-
\newcommand{\dotsbsmall}{\ldot\!\ldot\!\ldot}
\newcommand{\ldot}{\mathbin{.}}			% dot with math spacing
\newcommand{\nobf}[1]{\no \textbf{#1}}		% \no with bold number
\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{The \texttt{aligned} Environment},width=1.05\textwidth}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 &\:C_1x^{r_1}\,[\varphi_{r_1 0} \,+ \varphi_{r_1 1}\log x \,+ \dotsb + \varphi_{r_1 \alpha_1}(\log x)^{\alpha_1}]\\

+&\:C_nx^{r_n}[\varphi_{r_n 0} + \varphi_{r_n 1}\log x + \dotsb + \varphi_{r_n \alpha_n}(\log x)^{\alpha_n}],
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\[
\tag{98}
\left\{\qquad
\begin{aligned}
T_1 &= T_2 = T_3 (=T)\\
p_1 &= p_2 = p_3\\
s_1-s_2 &= \frac{(u_1-u_2)+p_1(v_1-v_2)}{T}\\
s_2-s_3 &= \frac{(u_2-u_3)+p_2(v_2-v_3)}{T}.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
\end{tcblisting}

\subsection{Interrupting a display}

In many instances you will want to interrupt a display with some text, you can use |\intertext|.

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\texttt{intertext},width=1.05\textwidth}
\begin{align}
U &= M u = M(c_v T + b)\\
S &= M(c_v  \log T + \frac{R}{m}  \log v + a),\\
\intertext{and}
F &= M \left\{T(c_v - a - c_v \log T) - \frac{RT}{m} \log v + b \right\}.
\end{align}
\end{tcblisting}

The command intertext can onl come after a |\\| or |\\| command. Its function is to preserve the alignment after the text is typeset. This is a common reuirement in many mathematical structures and the command is available in all of amsmath aligning environments.






\subsection{The alignat environment}
The alignat environment means \emph{align at} and can be used to align a set of equations vertically at more than one place.



\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=\textbf{alignat},width=1.05\textwidth}

When using one of the align environments, there should be no |\\| at the end of the
last line, otherwise you’ll get another equation number for this ``empty''  line


\clearpage
\subsection{Multline}
The |multline| environment is another attempt at displaying long equations. It will set the first line flush left and the last one flush right. It can be quite useful when one has very long equations. The line break is marked with |\\|. It is good typographical practice to have the first line shorter thn the last line and not the other way around.

Mathematical accents are a bit different that the ones used for normal text in order to cater, firstly for the exotic taste in diagratics taste by mathematicians and secondly to cater for the fact that mathematics is styled in italics.
This is a short summary of what is available.

\section{Brackets, braces and parentheses}

In addition  to the previous commands \cmd{Bigg} and \cmd{Biggm} can be used to add a bit more horizontal space.

\[3\Big\downarrow aˆ2+bˆ{cˆ2}
\Big\Downarrow\]


$$3\Big\updownarrow
aˆ2+bˆ{cˆ2}
\Big\Updownarrow$$

Another way to typeset the big separators is to split them over a line as shown below

{\arraycolsep=2pt
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{array}{rcl}
 \frac{1}{2}\Delta(f_{ij}f^{ij}) & = & 2\Bigg({\displaystyle
 \sum_{i<j}}\chi_{ij}(\sigma_{i}-\sigma_{j})^{2}+f^{ij}%
 \nabla_{j}\nabla_{i}(\Delta f)+\\
 & & +\nabla_{k}f_{ij}\nabla^{k}f^{ij}+f^{ij}f^{k}[2
 \nabla_{i}R_{jk}-\nabla_{k}R_{ij}]\Bigg)
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}

This is achieved by typing

\begin{teX}
{\arraycolsep=2pt
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{array}{rcl}
 \frac{1}{2}\Delta(f_{ij}f^{ij}) & = & 2\Bigg({\displaystyle
 \sum_{i<j}}\chi_{ij}(\sigma_{i}-\sigma_{j})^{2}+f^{ij}%
 \nabla_{j}\nabla_{i}(\Delta f)+\\
 & & +\nabla_{k}f_{ij}\nabla^{k}f^{ij}+f^{ij}f^{k}[2
 \nabla_{i}R_{jk}-\nabla_{k}R_{ij}]\Bigg)
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}

\section{Maths Typesetting}

\texttt{
Handbook of Typography for the\\
Mathematical Sciences\\
Steven G. Krantz\\
January 21, 2003}\par

\url{http://www.faqorama.net/tecno/[LaTeX]%20Handbook%20of%20Typography%20for%20the%20Mathematical%20Sciences%20-%20S.G.Krantz%20(2003).pdf}


Ellen Swanson’s book Mathematics into Type is a unique and important contribution to the literature of technical typesetting. It set a
standard for how mathematics should be translated from a handwritten
manuscript to a printed book or document. While Swanson’s book was
intended primarily as a resource for technical typesetters, it was also important to mathematical and other technical authors who wanted to take
an active role in ensuring that their work reached print in an attractive
and accurate form.
The landscape has now changed considerably. With the advent and
wide availability of TEX,
1
most mathematicians can take a more active
role in producing typeset versions of their work. Indeed, many mathematicians currently use TEX to write preliminary versions of their work
that are very similar (in many respects) to what will ultimately appear
in print.

While the output from \tex has a more typeset appearance than that
from most word processors, the TEX product is not automatically (without human intervention) \enquote{ready to go to press}. There are still \enquote{postprocessing} typesetting issues that must be addressed before a work
actually appears in print. The style and format of running heads, section headings and other titles, the formatting of theorems and other
enunciations, the text at the bottom of the page, page break issues, and
the fonts and spacing used in all of these go under the name of “page design”. These are often customized for a particular book or journal. The
index and table of contents must be designed and typeset. Graphics,
and sometimes new fonts, must be integrated. Additional questions of
style in the formatting of equations and superscripts and subscripts can
also arise. Most TEX users do not know how to handle the questions just
listed, which is why most publishers currently send TEX documents for
books or journal articles to a third-party TEX consultant. The purpose
of the present work is to serve as a touchstone for those who want to
learn to make typesetting decisions themselves.

\[ \smsqr{a}{c} \]

There are other aspects of consistency about which many authors
are blissfully unaware: spacing above and below a displayed equation,
spacing above and below a theorem,6
space after a proof, the mark at
the end of a proof (QED, or the Halmos "tombstone" |\qed|, for example).\sidenote{ "The symbol is definitely not my invention — it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like \(\boxed{\thinspace}\), and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.", Paul R. Halmos, I Want to Be a Mathematician: An Automathography, 1985, p. 403.}
Again, a good macro can be invaluable in addressing these issues; but
awareness of the problem is also a great asset.

life easier if you eschew the eccentric and stick to the most basic constructions. This advice is valid for the Plain \tex user, for the \latex

\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Choose your notation carefully}

Bad notation can make good exposition bad and bad exposition worse; ad hoc decisions about notation, made mid-sentence in the heat of composition, are almost certain to result in bad notation. Good notation has a kind of alphabetical harmony and avoids dissonance. Example: either + by$ or +a_2x_2$ is preferable to $bx_2$. Or: if you must use $\Sigma$ for an index set, make sure you don't run into $\sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma}a_\sigma$. Along the same lines: perhaps most readers wouldn't notice that you used $Izl$.

\newthought{One symbol, one letter}

A mathematical symbol is usually indicated by \emph{one} letter, not two or three. If for example we want to suggest that the \textit{factor of safety} is equal to three, we should write
\[F_{\mathrm{s}}=3\]
and not
\[F_{\mathrm{safetyfactor}}=3\]
or worse
\[F_{\mathrm{sf}}=3\]
typesetting the subscript in \textit{italic} font is also wrong
\[F_{s}=3\]
as it does not represent a mathematical symbol, but is just an abbreviation for safety factor.

Sometimes the use of the one symbol one letter rule cannot be applied, without the notation becoming complex
\medskip

{
\narrower\narrower
The static friction force \(F_{\mathrm{sf}}\) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the [[coefficient of static friction]] \(\mu_{\mathrm{sf}}\) multiplied by the normal force \(F_N\). In other words the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:

\[ \le F_{\mathrm{sf}} \le \mu_{\mathrm{sf}} F_\mathrm{N}. \]

The kinetic friction force \(F_{\mathrm{kf}}\) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:

\[F_{\mathrm{kf}} = \mu_{\mathrm{kf}} F_\mathrm{N}\]

where \(\mu_{\mathrm{kf}}\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
}




\newthought{Do not start a sentence with an equation}

\newthought{Display math}

In general mathematics typeset better when they are displayed. Use inline maths only for the simplest of equations and for explanations of symbols and the like. watch out for inconsistent spacing before and after displayed math.

\newthought{Correct badly sized math}

Some \tex constructions typeset rather badly, consider for example this:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{\gamma}} = \sqrt{X} + \sqrt{y}
\]

\noindent or this,

\[
\surd{\frac{\beta}{\gamma}} = \surd{X} + \surd{y}
\]


You can remedy this by using a \cmd{mathstrut}.


\emphasis{sqrt,mathstrut}
\begin{teXX}
\sqrt{\mathstrut a}=\sqrt{\mathstrut X}+\sqrt{\mathstrut y}
\end{teXX}

\newthought{Multiplication}

One of the most common errors is to use the ``dot'' to indicate multiplication between scalars\sidenote{\url{http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb29-2/tb92guiggiani.pdf}}. For example the folowing formul\ae
\[a\cdot x^2+b\cdot x+c=0\]
should be written as
\[ax^2+bx+c=0\]

In fact, for the the sake of simplicity, the standard multiplication between letters, or between letters, or between a number and a letter, does not require any symbol. If, on the other hand, the multiplication is between two numbers, the $\times$ or $\cdot$ symbols are required to avoid ambiguity.
For example you should write

\[2\times 3=6 \text{ and not } 2\thickspace 3=6 \]


\newthought{Using the right font}

The Euler equation involves the five most important mathematical constants. First we typest it with no space corrections\sidenote{\texttt{\textbackslash eu\^\,\{\textbackslash iu\textbackslash pi\}}},
% The number `e'
\providecommand*{\eu}%
{\ensuremath{\mathrm{e}}}
% The imaginary unit
\providecommand*{\iu}%
{\ensuremath{\mathrm{j}}}
\[\scalebox{3}{$\eu^{\iu\pi}$}\]
a small correction to the space should be added

\[\scalebox{3}{$\eu^{\,\iu\pi}$}\]

\subsection{Differential operators}
A peculiar defnition is required to properly
write the differential symbol. It is in fact an operator that has a space only on its left. In Beccari (2007b) the following solution is proposed:

because of the periodicity of the Jacobi theta functions involved in the construction of the vectors.
The height difference between starting point and endpoint of the path is thus $Lp$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:path}. Moreover, because of the periodicity of the theta functions it is sufficient to restrict the initial height to $\ell_1=0,1,\dots,L-1$ in this case.

It is interesting to note that Knuth believes that in equations this is unecessary.
He is quoted in Typesetting Mathematics.

\begin{quotation}
But where Don wrote 1000000 they substituted
1,000,000. Don objected that although this might be justifed in text, his use is perfectly OK in a formula. Well then, they replied, write \(10^6\).
Fine, said, Don, but what do I do 
when the number is 1234567? The IEEE standard here is to insert spaces, thus: 1 234 567.
Don doesn't like this in formulae, but agrees that it may be useful in a high precision context, such as numerical tables. 
\end{quotation}

The following are extracts from his paper \sidenote{\url{http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/papers/jfsp.tex.gz}}

{
$$\vcenter{\halign{$#$\hfil\ &$#$\hfil\cr
\Sigma n^{11}&=39916800{n+6\choose 12}+
19958400{n+5\choose 10}+3160080{n+4\choose 8}

}

Also, note in the last equation the use of a period at the end. This is something that strong opinions and flaming wars in fora. I am not too sure if I agree on the last one, but the way that Knuth writes is very clear and his equations in a way are paragraphs. In this case the use of a period is recommended.


\newthought{Punctuation}

There are two schools of thought when it comes to punctuation, that is punctuation in display style formulae. Some authors (Beccari,2007 a), others that it is necessary and essential.

The authors of this article believe that formulae,
both in display and text style, are part of the argumentation
and so punctuation should be used to help
the reader. An example of good use of punctuation is:


Since
$$ a=b $$
and
$$b=c,$$
it is proven that
\[a =c. \]



\subsection{Numbering Equations}

One question that you may face is the numbering of display equations. Early books used numbering sparingly, whereas many authors go overboard and number all the equations.

According to Knuth et al:\footnote{\url{http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf}}

Numbering all displayed formulas is usually a bad idea; number the important ones only.
Halmos\footnote{\url{http://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/Books/Halmos-How-To-Write.pdf}} offers pretty much the same good advice,

\begin{quotation}
What about "inequality (*)", or "equation (7)", or "formula (iii)"; should all displays be labelled or numbered? My answer is no. Reason: just as you shouldn't mention irrelevant assumptions or name irrelevant concepts, you also shouldn't attach irrelevant labels. Some small part of the reader's attention is attracted to the label, and some small part of his mind will wonder why the label is there. If there is a reason, then the wonder serves a healthy purpose by way of preparation, with no fuss, for a future reference to the same idea; if there is no reason, then the attention and the wonder were wasted.
\end{quotation}

See also discussion at \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29267/which-equations-should-be numbered/49080\#49080}

\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29267/which-equations-should-be-numbered/49080#49080}

Now if you wish to argue about this is fine.

\section{Mathmode}

TeX is in mathmode when it is reading mathematics. The |ifmmode| can be used to find out if TeX is in math mode. It denotes the start of an if-then-else control structure that tests whether \tex is currently in either math mode or display math mode. The |\else| part is optional. <TeX code 1> is processed if TeX is in one of the math modes, otherwise it is ignored. If the |\else| section is included and TeX is not in one of the math modes then <TeX code 2> is processed; otherwise it is ignored.

%\begin{teXXX}
%\def\A{\ifmmode \mathcal{A} \else $\mathcal{A}$ \fi}

\end{tcolorbox}
\medskip


defines a macro |\A| that can be used both in and out of math mode to typeset a calligraphy script A. 

This is a calligraphic \A\ or $\A$.

\section{Useful packages}
Besides the main packages that we have discussed so far and which should be in everyone's toolbox, there are a number of other packages that you may find useful. One such package is the |\multienum|, which although not really a packaged specializing in mathematical typesetting, it provides an environment to set multiple equations, as in an exercise or exam.

%\begin{teXXX}
%\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage{xstring,amsmath}
%\begin{document}
%\[\operatornamewithlimits{K}_{k=0}^\infty\frac{a_k}{b_k}\]
%\end{document}

\newthought{the multienum package}

The \docpkg{multienum} enables  the typestting of multiple equations on one line and numbering them, either with roman, arabic or alpha letters.

counter.

\begin{casestudy}[The Riemann hypothesis.]{%
Typeset the text and the equations, shown below. Use a standard minimal to achieve it. Note the fraktur fonts. Text must all be as one paragraph.}

It is well known that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ of a complex variable $s=\sigma+it$ is defined by
\[
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}
\]
for the real part $\mathfrak{R}(s)>1$ and its analytic continuation in the half plane $\sigma>0$ is
\begin{equation}\label{func:zeta}
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^{s}}-\frac{N^{1-s}}{1-s}-\frac{1}{2}N^{-s}
+s\int_{N}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{2}-\{x\}}{x^{s+1}}dx
\end{equation}
for any integer $N\geq1$ and $\mathfrak{R}(s)>0$.
It extends to an analytic function in the whole complex plane except for having a simple pole at $s=1$. Trivially, $\zeta(-2n)=0$ for all positive integers. All other zeros of the Riemann zeta functions are called its nontrivial zeros.

Please note that the maths and the text, are typed as a single block. Do not leave any spaces in between. We have used |\mathfrak| for the fraktur font. We have also used $it$ for the imaginary part. This would depend on the style used in your field.

\section{Gather}
This is like a multi line environment with no special horizontal alignment. All rows
are centered and can have an own equation number:

\begin{tcblisting}{colback=blue!5,boxrule=2pt,colframe=blue!75!black,title=The gather environment,width=\textwidth,before=\bigskip,after=\bigskip}
\def\O{\mathcal{O}}
\begin{gather}
 \O,\O(E_4),\O(E_2),\O(H-E_3-E_5),\O(H-E_3),\O(H-E_5),\\ 
\O(2H-E_1-E_3-E_5-E_6),\O(2H-E_1-E_3-E_5),\O(2H-E_3-E_5-E_6).
\end{gather}

So lautet der Beweis des Satzes $2 \times 2 = 4$:
\begin{gather}
(\Omega^{\nu})^{\mu}{}'x = \Omega^{\nu \times \mu}{}'x \text{ Def.}\\
%\begin{split}
\Omega^{2 \times 2}{}'x = (\Omega^{2})^{2}{}'x = (\Omega^{2})^{1 + 1}{}'x = \Omega^{2}{}'\Omega^{2}{}'x = \Omega^{1 + 1}{}'\Omega^{1 + 1}{}'x\nonumber \\
= (\Omega'\Omega)'(\Omega'\Omega)'x = \Omega'\Omega'\Omega'\Omega'x = \Omega^{1 + 1 + 1 + 1}{}'x = \Omega^{4}{}'x.
%\end{split}
\end{gather}


\begin{gather*}
x = \Omega^{0}{}' x \text{ Def.\ and}\\
\Omega'\Omega^{\nu}{}'x = \Omega^{\nu+1}{}'x \text{ Def.}
\end{gather*}
\begin{equation}
x = \Omega^{0}{}' x \text{ Def.\ and}\\
\Omega'\Omega^{\nu}{}'x = \Omega^{\nu+1}{}'x \text{ Def.}
\end{equation}
\end{tcblisting}


The gather environment has an implicit |{c}| horizontal alignment with no
vertical column alignment. It is just like an one column array/table.
A nonumber-version |\begin{gather*}...\end{gather*}| exists. 

A common error is to forget the include `\$\$` in intertext text, if you want to include
maths as part of the textual description.

\emphasis{intertext}
