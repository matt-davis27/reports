Bringhurst \cite{Bringhurst2005} while describing tables admonishes us that we should  `edit tables with the same attention given to text, and set them as text to be read'.

Tables are difficult to typeset and notoriously time-consuming. Newcomers to \latex\
If the table is not planned properly, like text they can go awry when approached on a
purely technical basis.

In general, tables are quite easy and straightforward in \latex 
Part of the price paid for that ease is that very complicated
tables may take excessive ingenuity and thought. There
are several issues here, but it is often a good idea to take a less
mechanistic approach to tables. What is the function of a table?
Why are we bothering to create one in the first place?
Sadly, many tables which appear in reports and books would
be better left out. They are included to lend a (spurious) air
of legitimacy and erudition. They ought to be there as part
of the development of the theme or argument. Sometimes
tables are an archival mechanism, so that others have all the
information needed to confirm or refute the arguments contained.
But too often the tables are merely included to confirm
that a great deal of worthy work was done, work which
should receive some recognition. Most tables are probably
unnecessary. Having said that, they will not go away.

The other point to make about tables is that they are very
strongly visual. In a broad sense, \latex tries to separate the
content of a document from its presentation, but with tables
this is probably problematic in general, and to look at the
specifics, choosing how columns are handled (or that the material
is presented as a column rather than a row), is surely
specifying many of the presentational aspects too. The same
content may be presented several different ways in a table.
Some ways will be confusing and difficult to understand. We
have only to consider the example of a railway timetable to
see just how difficult an apparently simple problem may be
to solve. We can therefore expect that a table may require
adjustment before it ‘works’.

All text should be horizontal, or in rare cases oblique. Setting the column heads vertically 
as a space-saving measure is quite feasble if the text is in Japanese or Chinese, 
but not if it is written in the Latin alphabet (see Table \ref{tbl:rotated}).

Provide a minimum amount of furniture (rules, boxes, dots and other guiderails for travelling through typographic space) and a maximum amount of information. There are two other rules, sometimes referred to as Fear's rules - after the name of the author of the \pkg{booktabs} package, the first one is that you should never ever use any vertical rules and the second one is to never use double rules\cite{booktabs}.


 Fear gives some more good advice,   units belong in the column heading and not the body of the table. Precede a decimal point by a digit; thus 0.1 not just .1, and do not use ‘ditto’ signs or any other such convention to repeat a previous value. In many circumstances a blank will serve just as well. If it won’t,
then repeat the value. You will need to search hard for cases where these rules need to ne broken, one such rule perhaps being the accounting tables of the Auditor General. 

A rule located at the edge of a table separating the first or final column from the adjacent empty space, ordinarily serves no function.
\end{multicols}

\section{The tabular environment}

Keeping these simple rules in mind before you delve into the code, the technicalities and the intricacies of the code. The \latex workhorse for typestting table sis the |tabular| environment, which we will illustrate with a short example:


\clearpage

\begin{multicols}{2}
To typesat a  table as shown on the right, we first need to enclose the table values within the tabular environment, columns are separated by an ampersand |&| and the end of the rows terminated with |\\|.
In this example we also introduce some rules from the |booktabs| package, as it is the right way to provide rules and we might as well introduce them early. We denote the justification of the columns, by using the directives \textbf{rl}, the \textbf{r}, denotes that the first column must be justified right, whereas the \textbf{l} instructs \latex to typeset the column, left justified. Most of the tabular formatting takes place here.

\textbf{Floating environment.}\quad While the example we just described, is fine typographically, it is inadequate for most publications, as it does not have a caption and was inserted exactly where we typed it. Floating environments are described in more detail later on, but all we had to float the table is to enclose it within a |table| environment.

\begin{teXXX}
\begin{table}[htp]
\begin{tabular}{rl}

                      & 50-65 letters\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Example table}
\medskip
Notice that the |table| environment also uses directives, \textbf{htp}, meaning you can place the table \textbf{h}ere or at the \textbf{t}op of a page or on a floats \textbf{p}age.
\end{multicols}
\clearpage

\begin{multicols}{2}
\texttt{\bf tabular*}

Besides the normal tabular command sequence, there is also a 
starred version of the tabular:

\begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}{|r|c|c|}
\hline
1971 & 41--54 & \$2.60 \\
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\bigskip

This looks particularly ugly. Later we'll see how to manipulate
this more elegantly. At the moment, it perhaps best
avoided. The use of \cmd{linewidth} requires some elaboration.
In a multicolumn environment or class, it takes the value of
the text within a column. In ‘normal’, single column setting,
it will also take a value corresponding to the current text
width. However, any valid expression of a dimension, as defined
in Chapter 3, is suitable.



\section{More tabular esoterica}

\textbf{Aligning at a decimal point.}\quad One recurrent theme with tables is the desire to align numerical
information on the decimal point. This is quite easily
achieved by use of one of the \textit{column specifiers}, the \textbf{@} specifier.
This allows text to be inserted at a given position in a
column (in every column), and suppresses the space which
is normally added between adjacent column entries. In this
context the suppression of space is `a good thing'. We can
specify the column formats like this:

\begin{teXXX}
\begin{tabular}{r@{.}lr@{.}l}
\end{teXXX}



to create two pairs of columns (that is, four columns in all).
Each pair is really a column aligned on a decimal point. We
therefore write the contents of the table like:

\begin{Code}
\begin{tabular}{r@{.}lr@{.}l}
\toprule
12  &3         & 156 &80 \\
0    &12345  &       &90 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{Code}

which produces:
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{r@{.}lr@{.}l}
\toprule
 12  &3      & 156 &80 \\
     0   &12345  &     &90 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
\noindent in order to make |12.3| and |0.12345| align correctly. Note that
we do not use the decimal point at all. We give the alignment
position, and we have already specified the extra text
to be added, the decimal point. 

The penalty we have paid
is to introduce extra columns. This means that we have to
be careful in specifying the column headings (or stubs), since
they should span two columns\footnote{This is a source of endless edits and mistakes in documents.}.


\textbf{Multicolumn cells.}\quad In many tables there is a need of merging two or more cells together. This can be achieved by the using the |\multicolumn| command. 

The \cmd{multicolumn} instruction makes this an easy problem
to solve: a full table might therefore look like \ref{tbl:aligned}:

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{rr@{.}lr@{ = }lr@{.}l}
\toprule
$\lambda_{ij}$&\multicolumn{2}{c}{$L_{R-I}$}&
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$DAR$}&
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$L_{R-P}$}\\
\midrule
70&4&60&6&80&5&10\\
80&10&70&12&10&11&20\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\captionof{table}{A simple table with the numbers aligned at the decimal point}
\label{tbl:aligned}


\begin{Code}
\begin{tabular}{r r@{.} r@{.} r@{.} }
\hline
$\lambda_{ij}$&\multicolumn{2}{c}{$L_{R-I}$}&
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$DAR$}&
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$L_{R-P}$}\\
\hline
70&4&60&6&80&5&10\\
80&10&70&12&10&11&20\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{Code}
\medskip



There is no need to enclose your text in grid prisons, in many instances simply intoducing a 
\cmd{toprule}, \cmd{midrule} and a \cmd{bottomrule} will suffice.
\medskip

\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{The \texttt{table} environment}

The tabular environment can typeset tabular information neatly. The \texttt{table} environment creates \textit{floating} tables. The table placement is controlled with an optional argument. Inside the table we can use the |\caption| to typeset a caption for the table. The starred version of the table produces an unumbered table, which is not listed in the list of tables.
\section{Long Tables}

Long tables offer problems if you are using \latex\. The package 
\pkg{longtable} offers macros to help with long tables. The table below shows such an example.

To use the |longtable| package, just include it normally as any other package. In lieu of typing
|\begin{table} ... \end{table}|, you just type begin{longtable} ... {longtable}. The package has numerous other useful commands, including command that break the page across pages horizontally. I would not recommend you do this. Such tables are virtually unreadable.

\end{multicols}

%% long table
%\input{./manual/listofservices}


\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{tabular}

The tabular environment can also align two tables side by side (See \ref{sidebyside}).


\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|}
\hline A \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|}
\hline A \\ B \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|}
\hline A \\ B \\ C\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Tables side by side}
\label{sidebyside}


There is also an option argument (in square braces), which
is another ‘positional’ argument, indicating where the table is
in a vertical sense. By default a table is aligned horizontally
along its centre, but you can align it on its top row, or its bottom
row (using t and b). Why should you want to do this?
Usually when you have several tables side by side. For the
sake of an example,

\begin{Code}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|}
\hline A \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|}
\hline A \\ B \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{Code}




\subsection{Restraining the width of some of the columns}

The \texttt{tabularx} takes the same arguments
as \texttt{tabular}, but modifes the widths of certain columns, rather than
the inter column space, to set a table with the requested total width. The
columns that may stretch are marked with the token \texttt{X} in the preamble
argument.



This package requires the \pkg{array} package.


\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{tabularx}{200pt}{|c|X|c|}
   one & \lipsum[1] &three \\
\end{tabularx}
\end{Verbatim}


{\scriptsize

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{3.0cm}|c|}
one & \lipsum[1] &three\\
\end{tabular}

}



The arguments of |tabularx| are essentially the same as those of the standard
|tabular*| environment. However rather than adding space between the columns
to achieve the desired width, it adjusts the widths of some of the columns. The
columns which are affected by the |tabularx| environment should be denoted with
the letter X in the preamble argument. The X column specification will be converted
to p{$<some value>$} once the correct column width has been calculated.

Whatever you can achieve with |tabularx|, you can achieve with |tabular| as well. The package uses
the |p{}| to calculate the widths. Personally, I prefer to stay with |tabular| and only use it for
the occassional difficult table.

\textbf{\Large USING MATHS IN TABULAR ENVIRONMENTS}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Sometimes the material to be displayed especially if it is of a mathematical nature can best be displayed using one of the maths environments available. Consider \fref{fig:align}. This is from a question and answers assignment. We need to align all the numbers including the numbers 9,8 and 7 in the last three rows.
To do this we use the following code:
\medskip
\emphasis{Z,begin,end,align,*}
\begin{teXXX}
\begin{align*}
  1 +  12 &= 13\\
  2 +  11 &= 13\\
  3 +  10 &= 13\\
  4 + \Z9 &= 13\\
  5 + \Z8 &= 13\\
  6 + \Z7 &= 13
\end{align*}
\end{teXXX}
\medskip

Notice the use of |\Z|, which we will define below. This is used as a |\phantom|
command to push the numeral to the right. The use of the |align*| environment, is in many respects much more easier than use of the normal tabular environment.

\columnbreak

\begin{align*}
1 +  12 &= 13\\
2 +  11 &= 13\\
3 +  10 &= 13\\
4 + \Z9 &= 13\\
5 + \Z8 &= 13\\
6 + 7 + 12&= 25
\end{align*}
\captionof{table}{Equations displayed using the \textbackslash align* environment.}
\label{fig:align}
\medskip
\end{multicols}


\begin{multicols}{2}
\textbf{\Large Using the array package.}\quad Both |tabular| as well as the |array| environments can display tabular data. The latter should be used for tables that are predominantly requiring mathmode.

Another way to display tabular environments is to actually build them up from simpler
parts and use the |array| environment.  Table \tref{tbl:aliquot}  from \textit{Short Cuts in Figures} by A. Frederick Collins, shows such an example.

Before we get with the typesetting of the table we can need to define some helper macros. As we want to display the headings more all less in equal boxes, we need to grab the length of the longest word, in this case we choose the word \texttt{equivalent},
\emphasis{\settowidth,\TmpLen}
\begin{teXXX}
\settowidth{\TmpLen}{Equivalent}
\end{teXXX}
%
%
\settowidth{\TmpLen}{Equivalent}

Once the width of the column heading is known we can then typeset them in a |parbox|:

\emphasis{\parbox,TmpLen,centering}
\begin{teXXX}
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\centering Aliquot Part}
\end{teXXX}
which will produce: 
\medskip

\colorbox{gray!10}{\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\centering Aliquot Part}\hspace{0.5cm}
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\smallskip\centering Equivalent Parts\index{Equivalent parts}}
\hspace{0.5cm}\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\centering Whole Number}
}

There are two more sttings that we need to discuss, before we write the full code for the table:

\begin{teXXX}
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.2}
\setlength\arraycolsep{0.5em}
\end{teXXX}

The final code for the tabel is then:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{...}
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{...} 
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\ldots}\\
\Z2 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{50} & \text{of} & 100\\
.
.
.
\end{array}
\end{verbatim}

There are many more settings and ways to generalize the code, however for the time being this demonstrates how to use the |array| environment to produce nice looking tables.


\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.2}
\setlength\arraycolsep{0.5em}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\centering Aliquot Part}
&
&\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\smallskip\centering Equivalent Parts\index{Equivalent parts}\smallskip} 
&
&\parbox[c]{\TmpLen}{\centering Whole Number}\\
%
\hline
\Z2 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{50} & \text{of} & 100\\
\Z4 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{25} & \text{of} & 100\\
\Z5 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{20} & \text{of} & 100\\
 10 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{10} & \text{of} & 100\\
 20 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{5}  & \text{of} & 100\\
 25 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{4}  & \text{of} & 100\\
 50 & \text{is} & \frac{1}{2}  & \text{of} & 100\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

\textbf{\Large USING LEADERS IN TABLES}
\setlength{\columnsep}{2em}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\parindent1em
Before we call on this code we need to build some new utility commands 

\emphasis{phantom,TmpLen}
\begin{teXXX}
\newcommand\Z{\phantom{0}}
\newcommand\ZZ{\phantom{00}}
\newcommand\ZZZ{\phantom{000}}
\newcommand\ZZZZ{\phantom{0000}}
\newcommand\E{\mathrel{\phantom{=}}}
\end{teXXX}


The |\Z| commands are used to add some phantom space.\cmd{phantom} Any phantom object will occupy exactly the same space as if it were normally there, except it won't. A space will be filled with exactly the same dimensions as the object would normally occupy, so the command |\ZZZZ| will occupy exactly the space of four zeros.


Using Leaders is another technique that you can use to improve the readability of text in tables,although a bit dated. They guide the reader's eyes in cases where the text is a bit spaced out from the columns.

One interesting sideline mixing some of the matters discussed in earlier chapters is Table. This table is interesting in that it is not easy to be reproduced without a little bit of tinkering. The table shown in table \ref{tbl:romannumerals} uses some characters that are not easily found in font sets. We need to create these on the fly.

Although you might be tempted to dispel the necessity for large numbers by the Romans, you should think of the Colloseum. 

The Colosseum was designed to take a capacity of between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators. The admission to the Colosseum was completely free but everyone had to have a ticket - tickets assisted in crowd control. An exciting event would attract all of the million people who lived in Ancient Rome - without tickets there would have been chaos. 

Outside the Colosseum there was a barrier consisting of chains between 160 bollards to keep people out before the opening of the games. The Colosseum had something that resembled a seating chart. Each ticket was marked with was marked with a seat number, a tier number and a sector number which indicated the correct entrance gate. It was therefore imperative to ensure that the massive crowds who flocked to the Colosseum were seated quickly and efficiently.

The Tickets to the Colosseum were completely free to the Ancient Romans. However, they did have to be acquired in advance or face standing in line on the day of the games and perhaps obtaining a ticket for standing room only. The areas of seating reflected the social status of the Romans. There were four tiers of seating. The closer you were to the action in the arena, the higher was your status in Rome. If you were a 'Pleb' there was no way that you would have access to the first and second tiers which were strictly reserved for the most important people of Rome. Different classes of people would be recognised by their clothing and who they arrived with. The Emperor, his family, noble Patricians, senators, politicians, magistrates and visiting dignitaries.

\subsection{Coloring multirows}
If you use |\multirow| with the \pkg{colortbl} package you have to take precautions if you want to
colour the column that has the |\multirow| in it. |colortbl| works by colouring each cell separately.
So if you use |\multirow| with a positive |nrows| value, |colortbl| will first color the top cell, then
|\multirow| will typeset nrows cells starting with this cell, and later colortbl will color the other
cells, effectively hiding the text in that area. This can be solved by putting the |\multirow| in
the last row with a negative |nrows| value. See, for example:

\onelineheader{TABLES IN \TeX}

\begin{multicols}{2}
We have covered a lot of ground with \latex tables, without mentioning \tex's way of handling tables. This was done on purpose, as many people consider the usage of |\halign|, as difficult. In my opinion it is only difficult, as the packages are not always available, but the greatest difficulty is the provision of rules. This normally clutters the table and hides the data.

\parindent1em

Use LaTeX tables first, before you move on to typesetting them using only TeX commands is preferred. The time though has come to discuss them in more detail.

\textbf{The \textbackslash halign command.}\quad Tables in \tex are typeset using mainly the commands \cmd{halign},\cmd{omit} and \cmd{span}. The TeX command for horizontal alignment is |\halign|. It must be followed by a group of commands enclosed by braces. This block contains all rows of the table with the cells separated by the character "\&" and the rows separated by |\cr|. The rows containing the text actually to be printed are preceded by a special one called the preamble. It is a template into which the content of the table cells are put before being typeset. "\#" characters serve as placeholders for the cell entries. (Inside macro definitions, "\#\#" is used to avoid confusion with the macro arguments denoted by |#1|, |#2| etc.) One |#| must occur between every two |&|s. 
%http://www.volkerschatz.com/tex/halign.html

\begin{teXXX}
\halign{\hfil \it # & # \hfil \cr
3 cl & cream \cr
2 cl & beer \cr
1.5 cl & orang-utan soup \cr}
\end{teXXX}

The text in the first column is printed in italics (\cmd{it}) and aligned right. This is achieved by the \cmd{hfil}, which is a spacer with zero default width but infinite stretchability. Whenever something is aligned right, left or centred, this is achieved with such fillers. (They come in three powers: |\hfil|, |\hfill|, and |\hfilll|. Each is infinitely more stretchable than its predecessor. The last one is not predefined in LaTeX, but can be emulated by writing |\hskip 0pt plus 1filll|.) Likewise, the second column is aligned left. This fairly simple way blews into complexity, once one decides to employ frames:
\end{multicols}

\begin{teXXX}
{
\offinterlineskip

\textbf{Centering tables.}\quad The only way \text offers to center tables, is to use boxes and to use the appropriate amount of |\hfil|. Normally you will have to define a command for this:

\def\centertable#1{\hbox to \hsize {\hfill\vbox{%

If you want to programmatically, produce tables, in most cases it will be easier to revert back to using \tex directly, rather than going the long route of packages and \latex.

Consider the table shown below, that has been drawn by D.E.~Knuth, in one of his papers\footnote{D.E. Knuth, \textit{Johann Faulhaber and Sums of Powers}}. This was possibly before the days of picture drawing programs, so Knuth drew all the rules using a tabular environment. This is now so much more easy with packages like TikZ and even \latex's picture environment can do better.

%http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8082/how-to-use-valign

Just as |\halign| creates an alignment by specifying a prototype row, |\valign| creates an alignment by specifying a prototype column. Inside a |\valign|, |&| specifies the end of a row in a column, and |\cr| means "end-of-column"; each cell and column is typeset in (internal) vertical mode and the whole alignment is then passed to the paragraph builder (in horizontal mode).
